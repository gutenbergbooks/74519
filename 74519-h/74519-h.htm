  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Since the announcement of the alleged discovery of Priessnitz,
about fifty years ago, there has been no scarcity of books
upon “Hydropathy,” “Water Cure,” and kindred topics.
With rare exceptions, these works have been, in reality, little
better than advertising mediums for some individual or institution.
As might be expected in works prepared for such
purposes, they have contained numerous and flagrant exaggerations
of the effects of water as a remedial agent, often
representing it as a specific for certain maladies and a sure
preventive of others. These extravagant accounts, together with
various absurd teachings relating to methods of application,
have rendered just the popular verdict indicated by the fact
that the dingy shelves of nearly every second-hand book store
in New York and Philadelphia, as well as other large cities, are
laden with these musty old volumes which rest beneath the accumulated
dust of years.</p>

<p class='c007'>The objects of this work may be briefly summarized as follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'>1. To present a careful and candid account of the nature of
water and its physiological effects.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. To explain the effects of water when used as a remedy for
disease, and to demonstrate its value as a remedial agent.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. To show that the employment of water in the treatment
of disease has been practiced by the most eminent physicians
of all ages, and is not a modern discovery.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_iv'>iv</span>4. To expose those absurd and erroneous practices which
have brought the use of water as a remedy into disrepute, and
have thus deterred scientific physicians from adopting it.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. To provide a convenient manual of the various methods
of applying water.</p>

<p class='c007'>The reader will observe that water is not presented as a
panacea. Its use is not advocated as a specialty. It is only
recommended as one of the many potent agencies which may
be successfully employed in the treatment of the numerous ills
to which humanity is subject—a remedy which has been abused
by quacks and tyros and disgraced by fanatics, but which still
urges a just claim to the attention and consideration of all candid
persons.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>PHYSICAL PROPERTIES.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>Water is one of the most abundant elements
in nature. As rivers, lakes, seas,
and oceans, it covers three-fourths of the earth’s
surface. It even enters largely into the formation
of the solid rocks. The clearest and purest
air contains it in large quantities as an invisible
gas; while in clouds, fogs, and mists, it appears
in the form of minute drops.</p>

<p class='c007'>Water also forms a very considerable part of
all vegetable productions, and constitutes about
<i>three-fourths</i> of the human body, as well as other
animal tissues. The blood and the brain are each
about four-fifths water, while the fluid secretions
and excretions contain more than nine-tenths of
their weight of this limpid fluid.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Chemical Composition.</b>—The chemist designates
water as hydrogen oxide, and represents it
by the chemical formula, H<sub>2</sub>O, which signifies
that it is composed of the two gases, hydrogen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>and oxygen, in the proportion of two volumes of
the former to one of the latter. Both of these
gases are colorless, transparent, tasteless, and
odorless. Hydrogen is the lightest gas known;
oxygen is the great supporter of combustion and
animal life and heat. Water is produced by the
burning, or oxidation, of hydrogen, a process attended
with very little light, but most intense
heat. The two gases are explosive when mixed.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Physical Properties.</b>—Water exists in three
states; viz., as a solid, in the form of ice; as
a liquid, its most common form; and as a vapor,
in the form of steam. When in the last
condition, the gaseous, it is invisible. That to
which the term steam is very commonly applied,
is not steam, but water in a state of fine division,
or mist.</p>

<p class='c007'>Below 32° F., pure water exists in the form of
ice. Between 32° and 212°, it is a liquid. At 212°,
it is converted into vapor. Water also slowly
evaporates at all temperatures below 212°, being
absorbed and held in solution by the air.</p>

<p class='c007'>Water possesses the greatest specific heat of
any substance. By specific heat is meant the
actual amount of heat required to elevate its
temperature a given number of degrees. For example,
it requires ten times as much heat to raise
a pound of water 1° in temperature as to elevate
a pound of copper 1° in temperature. To raise
the temperature of a pound of lead 1°, requires
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>only one-thirtieth as much heat as to produce
the same effect upon a pound of water. Water
absorbs more heat by elevation of temperature
than any other substance. In passing from the
solid to the liquid state, it absorbs a vast amount
of heat without any elevation of temperature.
The same thing occurs in the conversion of water
into steam or vapor by evaporation. In the
evaporation of one pound of water, as much heat
is absorbed, or rendered latent, as would suffice
to raise nearly a thousand pounds of water one
degree in temperature. This heat is abstracted
from surrounding objects; and, hence, evaporation
is one of the most powerful means of producing
cold. The effect is the same, no matter what the
temperature at which evaporation occurs.</p>

<p class='c007'>Water is not the best conductor of heat, but
it conducts much more readily than air, and
readily communicates its heat to bodies with
which it comes in contact, also abstracting heat
when of a lower temperature, when changing
from a solid to a liquid state, or from the liquid
to the gaseous condition.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the most useful properties of water is
its power to dissolve numerous substances, its
solvent properties being nearly universal. To
this property it owes its value as a cleansing
agent.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Pure Water.</b>—Absolutely pure water is not
found in nature. Rain water is the nearest approach
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>to it; but even this gathers impurities of
various sorts as it falls through the air, and often
becomes very unwholesome by the absorption of
foul gases and the collection of dust in this way.
For any use connected with the human body, the
purest water is always preferable to any other.
Filtered rain water and distilled water are the
purest forms of water attainable.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Hard Water.</b>—Water is said to be hard when
it will not produce a good lather with soap, but
forms curds instead. Hardness is due to the
presence of earthy salts in the water; salts of
lime—chalk and gypsum—are the most common.
Ten grains per gallon of any of these salts is sufficient
to render water hard and unfit for use,
though some waters furnished to cities for general
use contain from 70 to 160 grains per gallon
of solid matter. Hard water is unfit for cleansing
purposes because its mineral ingredients form
insoluble compounds with fatty substances. When
mixed with soap, the lime or other mineral takes
the place of the soda or potash in the soap, and
forms an insoluble curd, instead of a lather.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Mineral Water.</b>—Water containing in solution
salts of iron, magnesia, or other metallic elements,
as well as sulphur, arsenic, iodine, or any compound
of these or other elements which are capable
of imparting a nauseous or saline taste,
an unpleasant odor, or medicinal properties, has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>been much employed for the cure of all sorts
of chronic ailments. Such waters are totally
unfit for general use for drinking or cooking purposes,
and certainly possess no particular advantages
as cleansing agents. Whether they are useful
as medicines is a medical question which we
do not purpose to consider here; but one would
naturally suppose that water which is unfit to
cleanse the outside of the body could not be of
very great utility as an internal application.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Magnetic Water.</b>—Within the last few years,
the scientific world has been startled with the
alleged discovery of “magnetic wells” and “magnetic
springs” in various parts of the country.
The claim has been made and stoutly defended
by interested parties that the water furnished
from these sources is magnetic in character,
and possesses wonderful healing virtues on
that account. The truth in the matter, when
viewed in the light of science, seems to be that
the water of these much-lauded wells is no more
magnetic than any other water; the magnetic
phenomena are all explicable by well-known laws
of physics, without attaching to the water any
magnetic properties. A close examination shows
that the iron pipe through which the water passes
is the only magnetic object. The supposition that
the pipe derives its magnetism from the water is
both unnecessary and illogical. In the first place,
any iron pipe or rod placed vertical in the ground—or,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>better, placed parallel to the earth’s axis—will
spontaneously become magnetic. The production
of magnetism is greatly favored by the
friction of flowing water, and by jarring, as beating
with a hammer. In the second place, the
water possesses no magnetism to impart. In
view of these facts, the conclusion is inevitable
that so-called magnetic water has no existence
except in the minds of certain persons whose
credulity greatly exceeds their scientific knowledge.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Magnetic” wells and springs are ingenious
humbugs. Thousands of people are duped by
them. Hundreds are benefited by getting well
washed, and by enjoying recreation and pleasant
social surroundings. The curative effects are
attributed to the imaginary magnetism, while
other more tangible agents are the real means of
cure.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>HYGIENIC RELATIONS OF WATER.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>In order to be able to appreciate the value of
water as a means of preserving health, it is necessary
to understand something of the structure
and functions of those portions of the body to
which it is directly applied; viz., the skin, externally,
and the mucous membrane, in the interior
of the body.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>STRUCTURE OF THE SKIN.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The skin is composed of two principal layers;
a thin outer layer, called the epidermis, cuticle,
or scarf skin, and a deeper structure, the true
skin, or dermis. We will describe the latter
first.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The True Skin.</b>—This structure covers the entire
surface of the body. It varies in thickness
according to its location, being thickest upon
the soles of the feet, the palms of the hands, the
back, and the outer portions of the thighs. Its
basis is a dense network of elastic fibers, among
which are intricately mingled minute blood-vessels,
nerve fibers, and lymphatic or absorbent vessels.
These are most numerous near the upper
surface, and are arranged in loops upon little elevations
called papillæ. In the palms of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>hands and upon the soles of the feet these papillæ
are disposed in rows with so much regularity as
to give to those parts a minutely furrowed appearance.</p>

<p class='c007'>The skin also contains little sacs, or follicles, in
which the hairs originate. In its deeper portions
are found two kinds of glands; sebaceous glands
for the secretion of sebaceous or fatty matter to
lubricate the skin, and the perspiratory or sweat
glands, the latter of which will receive a more
definite description shortly.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Cuticle, or Epidermis.</b>—At the upper portion
of the true skin, new cells are being constantly
formed, which become old in a short time and
are pressed outward by the formation beneath
them of other new cells. The old cells become
shriveled and flattened as they grow older, and
by a continuation of the process described, numerous
layers of cells are formed upon the surface
of the true skin, the lowest of which is
composed of newly formed cells, while the uppermost
one is made up of dessicated cells having
more the appearance of horny scales than of cells.
These several layers constitute the epidermis, or
outer skin. It is totally devoid of sensibility, and
has no blood-vessels. It is, in fact, dead, and is
useful only as a protection to living parts beneath.</p>

<p class='c007'>Scattered among the cells of the epidermis are
colored cells, which give to the skin its proper
color. In the Caucasian race, these cells are few;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>in the negro, they are abundant; while in the
albino, they are wholly absent.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Sweat Glands.</b>—A close examination of
the little ridges found upon the palms of the
hands, by the aid of a small magnifying glass,
will reveal what appear to be fine transverse lines
crossing the ridges at short intervals. A still
closer inspection shows that the apparent lines
are really minute openings, guarded by delicate
valves. These are the mouths of the perspiratory
ducts, which convey to the surface the product
of the sweat glands. The gland itself is merely
a coiled tube, already described as situated deep
down in the true skin, and is surrounded with a
network of blood-vessels. The duct is simply a
continuation of the same tube upward through
the cuticle to the surface. It passes out upon
the surface of the skin obliquely, thus leaving a
small portion of the cuticle overlapping its orifice,
forming a sort of valve.</p>

<p class='c007'>The number of these delicate glands is enormous.
It has been carefully estimated to be
about 2,300,000 in a single individual. The
length of each is about one-fifteenth of an inch,
making their aggregate length about two and
one-half miles.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Mucous Membranes.</b>—All cavities in the
body which communicate with the surface by
openings are lined with a membrane which is
called mucous, from the character of its secretion.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>The mucous membranes are continuous
with the skin at the natural openings of the body,
and very closely resemble it in structure, being
formed of several layers, like the skin, and having
a superficial portion made up of layers formed
by the deeper tissues. Mucous membrane forms
the lining of the air-passages and lungs, of the
whole alimentary canal, and of the urinal and
genital organs. Its extent in the lungs alone
has been estimated by scientists at 1400 square
feet, or more than seventeen times the whole extent
of the skin.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Functions of the Skin.</b>—The skin performs a
number of very important offices for the body.
Perhaps the most important is that of excretion.
Each of its millions of sweat glands is actively
and constantly engaged in separating from the
blood impurities which would destroy life if retained.
These foul products are poured out
through a corresponding number of minute sewers,
and deposited upon the surface of the body
to the amount of several ounces each day, or several
pounds, if the whole perspiration be included
in the estimate, as is commonly done.</p>

<p class='c007'>The skin is also an organ of respiration; it absorbs
oxygen, and exhales carbonic acid gas, with
other poisonous gases. The amount of respiratory
labor performed by the skin is about one-sixtieth
of that done by the lungs. In some of the lower
animals, the whole work of respiration is performed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>by the skin. In the common frog, the
respiratory action of the skin and of the lungs is
about equal.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another important office of the cutaneous tissue
is absorption. The absorption of oxygen has
been already referred to; but it absorbs liquids
as well as gases, and to a much greater extent.
By immersion in a warm bath for some time, the
weight of the body may be very considerably
increased. Dr. Watson, an English physician of
note, reports the case of a boy whose weight increased
nine pounds in twenty-four hours solely
by cutaneous absorption of moisture from the air.
This extraordinary action was occasioned by disease.
Seamen, when deprived of fresh water,
quench their thirst by wetting their clothing
with sea-water, the aqueous portion of which is
absorbed by the skin. The lymphatic vessels are
believed to be the principal agents in absorption.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another remarkable function of the skin is the
regulation of temperature. By its density and
non-conducting property it prevents the escape
of necessary heat to a considerable degree. But
when the amount of heat generated in the body
becomes excessive, either from abnormal vital
activities, or by exposure to external heat, the
skin relieves the suffering tissues by favoring the
escape of heat. This desirable end is attained
through the evaporation of the moisture poured
out upon the surface by the perspiratory glands.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has been estimated that the evaporation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>of water from the cutaneous surface and the mucous
membrane of the lungs occasions the loss
each minute of sufficient heat to raise a pint of
water 100° F. in temperature. This is certainly
a powerful cooling process.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lastly, we mention as a further function of the
skin, and one which is not the least in importance,
its utility as a sensitive surface. It is a
well-established physiological fact that the mind
is only a reflection of impressions received from
without, or at least that its character is largely
determined by the nature of the impressions
made upon its organs of sensibility. The skin is
the organ of touch, and the various modifications
of tactile sensibility. It is the most extensive
organ of sensibility in the body, and is very
closely connected with all the great nerve centers,
so that it is perhaps the most efficient means
through which to affect the general nervous system.
Its intimate sympathy with internal organs
is shown in a great number of diseases in which
this organ evidently suffers on account of disability
of some other one.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Functions of the Mucous Membranes.</b>—The
functions of the mucous membranes are strictly
analogous to those of the skin. Like the
latter organ, a mucous membrane excretes and
absorbs. It eliminates foul matters, and absorbs
useful substances in a fluid state.</p>

<p class='c007'>The importance of the functions of the skin is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>shown by the fact that a person quickly dies
when its action is interrupted. A coat of varnish
or caoutchouc, applied over the whole skin, will
kill a man almost as quickly as a fatal dose of
strychnia. In experiments upon animals, horses,
dogs, and other animals have been killed by obstructing
the action of the skin by some similar
means. A little boy was once killed by covering
him with gold leaf to make him represent an
angel at a great celebration.</p>

<p class='c007'>The offensive odor of the perspiration, and the
characteristic smell of the sweat-soiled underclothing
of a tobacco user, are facts which well
attest the value of the cutaneous functions in removing
impurities from the body.</p>

<p class='c007'>We are now prepared to consider, understandingly,—</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Hygienic Value of Water.</b>—If we except
pure air, it may safely be said that no other element
in nature sustains so important relations to
the living system as does pure water. An individual
will live much longer on water alone, than
if deprived of drink. Water constitutes a large
proportion of all our food, varying, in grains and
vegetables, from fifteen to more than ninety per
cent. If the water thus contained in solid food
were wholly removed, an individual would doubtless
be enabled to subsist longer on water only
than on solid food so treated. Though water undergoes
no change in the body, and hence takes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>no part in the development of force, it is absolutely
essential to the performance of the vital
functions, being necessary to enable the various
organs to perform their offices in the maintenance
of the vital activities.</p>

<p class='c007'>The circulatory system is especially dependent
upon this element. Water is the menstruum
which floats the blood corpuscles and the varied
nutritive and excrementitious elements which
form the blood. By its aid, the nutrient particles
destined to enter into the structure of the
body are conveyed to the most minute and remote
fiber of the intricate human mechanism where
repair or growth is demanded. No other element
in nature is so well suited to this exact purpose
as water. It is so limpid and mobile that it can
circulate through the most delicate capillaries
without friction, and can even find its way, by
osmosis, into parts inaccessible by openings.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Thirst.</b>—Water is continually passing away
from the body. The dry air entering the lungs
by respiration absorbs it from the moist surface
of the pulmonary membranes. A large portion
is lost by evaporation from the skin, upon which
it is poured out by millions of little sewers, the
perspiratory ducts, for the purpose of washing
away impurities from the system. The kidneys
remove a considerable quantity, with poisonous
excrementitious elements in solution. Through
still other channels water is removed, aggregating,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>in all, the amount of five pints in twenty-four
hours in the average individual. This loss
must be made good, in order to preserve the requisite
fluidity of the blood; and nature expresses
the demand for water by thirst.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some people rarely drink liquid of any kind.
Others consume several pints in a day. The nature
of an individual’s occupation will in a
measure determine the amount of drink required.
Stokers, glass-blowers, and others whose vocation
necessitates profuse perspiration, require more
water than others. It will be noticed, moreover,
that the character of the diet has much to do with
the demand for drink. Those who subsist mostly
upon fruits and grains, and other vegetable productions,
avoiding the use of stimulating and irritating
condiments, require little or no addition
to the juices contained in their food. Those who
pursue an opposite course in dietetics, using
largely animal food, salt, pepper, spices, and other
condiments, and perhaps taking a little wine or
something stronger for their stomach’s sake, are
under the necessity of taking considerable quantities
of fluid in addition to that provided by their
food.</p>

<p class='c007'>Water is the only substance which will quench
thirst. Beverages which contain other substances
are useful as drinks just in proportion to the
amount of water which they contain, and are unwholesome
just in proportion as the added elements
are injurious.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span><b>Regulation of Temperature.</b>—The evaporation
of water from the surface of the human body is
one of the most admirable adaptations of means
to ends exhibited in animal life. All of the vital
activities in constant operation in the body
occasion the production of heat. Sometimes the
amount of heat is greater than is needed, and so
great as would destroy the vitality of certain tissues
if it were not speedily conducted away. By
evaporation of water from the skin, this is accomplished.
When external heat is great, perspiration
is more active than when it is less, and thus
the temperature of the body is maintained at
about 100° F. under all circumstances. By this
wonderful provision of nature, man is enabled to
exist under the great extremes of heat and cold
presented in the frigid regions at the poles and
the torrid climate of the equator. By the aid of
clothing, human beings have survived a continued
temperature of 60° to 100° below zero; and,
by the protective influence of evaporation, an
average of 100° above zero has been endured in
tropical climes. For short periods, so great a degree
of heat as 350° F., or even 600° has been borne
with impunity in exceptional instances. In these
cases the extreme heat which would otherwise
reduce the body to a cinder in a few moments is
rapidly conducted away by evaporation without
occasioning any damage.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span><b>Depuration.</b>—Every thought, every movement,
the most delicate vital action, occasions the destruction
of a portion of the living tissues, which
is thus converted into dead matter, and becomes
poisonous. Many kinds of poisonous substances
are produced within the body in this way.
Some of them are very deadly, and must be
hurried out of the system with great rapidity,
as <i>urea</i> and <i>cholesterine</i>. Here the marvelous
utility of water is again displayed. It dissolves
these poisons wherever it comes in contact with
them, and then as it is brought by the current
of the circulation to the proper organs—the
kidneys, liver, skin, lungs, and other emunctories—it
is expelled from the body, still holding
in solution the animal poisons which are so rapidly
fatal if retained.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Cleanliness.</b>—The skin is one of the most important
depurating organs of the whole body.
From each of its millions of pores constantly
flows a stream laden with the poisonous products
of disintegration. As the water evaporates, it
leaves behind these non-volatile poisons, which
are deposited as a thin film over the whole surface
of the skin. As each day passes, the process
continues, and the film thickens. If the skin
is moderately active, three or four days suffice
to form a layer which may be compared to a thin
coating of varnish or sizing. The accumulation
continues to increase, unless removed, and soon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>undergoes further processes of decomposition. It
putrefies, rots, in fact, and develops an odor characteristic
and quite too familiar, though anything
but pleasant, being at once foul, fetid, putrid, pungent,
uncleanly, and unpardonable.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the offense to the nose is not the extent of
the evil. The unclean accumulation chokes the
mouths of the million little sewers which should
be engaged in eliminating these poisons, and thus
obstructs their work. Being retained in contact
with the skin, some portions are reabsorbed, together
with the results of advancing decay, thus
repoisoning the system, and necessitating their
elimination a second time.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here water serves a most useful end if properly
applied. It is unexcelled as a detergent,
and by frequent application to the skin will keep
it wholly free from the foul matters described.
The necessity for frequent ablutions is well shown
by the fact that nearly two pounds of a poison-laden
solution, the perspiration, is daily spread
upon the surface of the body. It is not an uncommon
occurrence to meet with people who
have never taken a general bath in their lives.
Imagine, if possible, the condition of a man’s skin,
at the age of seventy or eighty years, which has
never once felt the cleansing effects of a thorough
bath!</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the most serious effects of this accumulation
of filth is the clogging of the perspiratory
ducts. Their valve-like orifices become obstructed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>very easily, and depuration is then impossible.
It is not wonderful that so many people have torpid
skins. The remedy is obvious, and always
available.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>How to Make the Skin Healthy.</b>—A man who
has a perfectly healthy skin is nearly certain to
be healthy in other respects. In no way can the
health of the skin be preserved but by frequent
bathing. A daily or tri-weekly bath, accompanied
by friction, will keep the skin clean, supple,
and vigorous. There is no reason why the
whole surface of the body should not be washed
as well as the face and hands. The addition of
a little soap is necessary to remove the oily secretion
deposited upon the skin.</p>

<p class='c007'>A lady of fashion, in enumerating the means
for preserving beauty, says: “Cleanliness, my
last recipe (and which is applicable to all ages),
is of most powerful efficacy. It maintains the
limbs in their pliancy, the skin in its softness,
the complexion in its luster, the eyes in their
brightness, the teeth in their purity, and the constitution
in its fairest vigor. To promote cleanliness,
I can recommend nothing preferable to
bathing. The frequent use of tepid baths is not
more grateful to the sense than it is salutary to
the health and to beauty.... By such
means, the women of the East render their skins
softer than that of the tenderest babe in this climate.”
“I strongly recommend to every lady to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>make a bath as indispensable an article in her
house as a looking-glass.”</p>

<p class='c007'>When the foul matters which ought to be eliminated
by the skin and quickly removed from
the body are allowed to remain unremoved, the
skin becomes clogged and inactive, soon loses its
natural luster and color, becoming dead, dark,
and unattractive. When bathing is so much
neglected, it is no marvel that paints, powders,
lotions, and cosmetics of all sorts, are in such
great demand. A daily bath, at the proper temperature,
is the most agreeable and efficient of all
cosmetics.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Bathing Protects against Colds.</b>—It is an erroneous
notion that bathing renders a person
more liable to “take cold, by opening the
pores.” Colds are produced by disturbance of
the circulation, and not by opening or closing the
pores of the skin. Frequent bathing increases
the activity of the circulation in the skin, so that
a person is far less subject to chilliness and to
taking cold. An individual who takes a daily
bath has almost perfect immunity from colds,
and is little susceptible to changes of temperature.
Colds are sometimes taken after bathing,
but this results from some neglect of the proper
precautions necessary to prevent such an occurrence,
which are carefully stated elsewhere in
this work.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span><b>Aristocratic Vermin.</b>—Doubtless, not a few of
those very refined and fastidious people who
spend many hours in the application of all sorts
of lotions and other compounds to the face
and hands, for the purpose of beautifying those
portions of the skin exposed to view—while neglecting
as persistently those parts of the skin
protected from observation—would be very much
surprised to learn the true condition of the unwashed
portions of their cutaneous covering. They
instinctively shrink with disgust from the sight of
a vermin-covered beggar, in whose cuticle burrows
the <i>acarus scabiei</i> (itch-mite), while troops
of larger insects are racing through his tangled
locks and nibbling at his scaly scalp. It is quite
possible that many a fair “unwashed” would
faint with fright if apprized of the fact that her
own precious covering is the home of whole
herds of horrid looking parasites which so nearly
resemble the itch-mite as to be at least very
near relatives, perhaps half-brothers or cousins.
The name of this inhabitant of skins unwashed
is as formidable as the aspect of the creature,
though it does not require a microscope to display
its proportions, as does the latter; scientists
call it <i>demodex folliculorum</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>demodex</i> makes himself at home in the
sebaceous follicles, where he dwells with his family.
Here the female lays her eggs and rears her
numerous progeny, undisturbed by the frictions of
any flesh-brush, and only suffering a very transient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>deluge at very long intervals, if such a casualty
ever happens. In studying the structure
of these little parasites, we have found several
tenants occupying a single follicle, pursuing their
domestic operations quite unmolested by any external
disturbance.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>demodex</i> has been transplanted from the
human subject to the dog; and it is found that
the new colony thrives very remarkably, and
soon produces a disease apparently identical with
that known as “mange.”</p>

<p class='c007'>We have not space to describe in detail these
savage little brutes, with their eight legs, armed
with sharp claws, bristling heads, sharp lancets
for puncturing and burrowing into the skin, and
their powerful suckers for drawing the blood of
their victims. We only care to impress upon the
mind of the reader the fact that neglect of bathing
and friction of the skin is sure to encourage
the presence of millions of these parasites, and
that the only remedy is scrupulous cleanliness of
the whole person. Like their relatives, the itch-mite,
they do not thrive under hydropathic treatment,
and are very averse to soap and water.
The best way to get rid of them is to drown
them out. They do not produce the irritation
which characterizes the presence of the itch insect,
so that this evidence of their presence is
wanting. But they are sure to be present in a
torpid, unhealthy, unwashed skin, no matter how
delicate or fastidious its possessor.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span><b>Prevention of Disease.</b>—Neglecting to keep
the skin active and vigorous by frequent ablutions
is one of the most prolific causes of nearly
all varieties of skin diseases, which are too often
aggravated by gross dietetic habits. The relation
between the cutaneous function and that of
the kidneys is so intimate that neglect of the
kind mentioned, resulting as it must in obstruction
of function, is a very common cause of most
dangerous disorders of the renal organs. Inactivity
of the skin is also very commonly associated
with dyspepsia, with rheumatism, gout,
hysteria, and other nervous derangements. It is
also a not uncommon cause of bronchial and pulmonary
affections. It is quite evident, then, that
the proper and most efficient means of preventing
these diseases is to maintain the functional
vigor of the skin by the proper application of
water.</p>

<p class='c007'>The value of water as a prophylactic, or preventive,
of disease, was recognized by the ancients,
and the bath was employed by them to an extent
which has never been equaled in modern times.
The great Hebrew lawgiver, Moses, enjoined upon
his followers the most scrupulous cleanliness,
making bathing a part of their religious duties.
His example was followed by the ingenious founder
of Mohammedanism, who required his disciples
to bathe before each of their five daily prayers.
Among the Greeks, and especially the temperate
Spartans, the bath was regarded as one of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>most essential means of securing physical health.
Daily ablutions were practiced by them, every
person participating in the bath, from the newborn
babe to the oldest inhabitant. The Romans
cultivated bathing to a remarkable extent,
making it a luxury rather than the dreaded penance
which many moderns seem to regard it.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Modern Neglect of the Bath.</b>—The most celebrated
physicians, from Hippocrates down to
Galen, Celsus, Boerhaave, and a host of more
modern physicians, have agreed in eulogizing the
bath as an invaluable means for preserving the
health. Notwithstanding this fact, it seems that
as civilization and enlightenment have advanced,
the importance of the bath has been increasingly
disregarded. The magnificent public baths
of the Romans were neglected as that empire
declined, until they were finally destroyed.
Michelet, a historian of some note, tells us that
for a thousand years during the Dark Ages the
bath was unknown in Europe. This fact alone
is in his opinion sufficient to account for the terrible
plagues and pestilences of that period. A
modern writer declares that in Spain the religious
instincts of the people have become so perverted
that it is considered sacrilege for a woman
to bathe more than once in her life, which is upon
the eve of her marriage. In more enlightened
countries, it is to be hoped that the condition of
the feminine cuticle is not quite so bad as this;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>but another writer, an Englishman, asserts that
a large proportion of his countrymen “never submitted
themselves to an entire personal ablution
in their lives, and many an octogenarian has sunk
into his grave with the accumulated dirt of eighty
years upon his skin.” American customs in this
respect are not much better than the English;
but it is gratifying to know that a very perceptible
improvement is becoming evident in both
countries. Our intercourse with Oriental nations
and barbarians has taught us wholesome lessons
in the care of the person. There is scarcely a
savage tribe to be found in the deepest jungles
of tropical Africa the members of which do not
pay more attention to the preservation of a
clean and healthy skin than the average American
or Englishman.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Bathing a Natural Instinct.</b>—All nature attests
the importance of the bath. The rain is
a natural shower bath in which all vegetation
participates, and gains refreshment. Its invigorating
influence is seen in the brighter appearance,
more erect bearing, and fresher colors, of all
plants after a gentle rain. The flowers manifest
their gratitude by exhaling in greater abundance
their fragrant odors. Dumb animals do not neglect
their morning bath. Who has not seen the
robin skimming along the surface of the lake or
stream, dipping its wings in the cool waters, and
laving its plumage with the crystal drops which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>its flapping pinions send glittering into the air?
No school boy who has ever seen the elephant
drink will forget how the huge beast improved
the opportunity to treat himself to a shower bath,
and perhaps the spectators as well, for he is very
generous in his use of water.</p>

<p class='c007'>If man’s instincts were not rendered obtuse
by the perverted habits of civilization, he would
value the bath as highly and employ it as freely
as his more humble fellow-creatures, whose instinctive
impulses have remained more true to
nature, because they have not possessed that degree
of intelligence which would make it possible
for them to become so grossly perverted as have
the members of the human race. Man goes
astray from nature not because he is deficient in
instinct, but because he stifles the promptings of
his better nature for the purpose of gratifying his
propensities.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Some of the relations of water to the living
system have been considered in the preceding
section. In the present connection we shall consider
chiefly those effects resulting from the application
of water to the human body in various
ways which give to it its value as a remedial
agent, though its therapeutical applications will
be deferred to succeeding sections.</p>

<p class='c007'>The effects of water upon the human system
are the results of the operation of its physical
properties in conjunction with the vital forces.
As with all other agents, its effects may be either
local, or general, according to the mode of application.
Different effects are also produced according
as the administration is internal or external.
Many other modifying circumstances, as
age, sex, and physical condition, affect the results
in a greater or lesser degree.</p>

<p class='c007'>Water affects the system through three different
means; viz.:—</p>

<p class='c007'>1. As a diluent;</p>

<p class='c007'>2. By its solvent properties;</p>

<p class='c007'>3. By modifying the general or local temperature
of the body.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>1. Water as a Diluent.</b>—Water is received into
the system by absorption, either through a mucous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>membrane, or through the skin. It usually
enters through the medium of the stomach and
intestinal canal. When received into the blood,
it of course increases its volume, and produces
an increased fullness of the circulatory vessels,
which are never distended to their fullest extent,
and hence allow room for change in the volume
of their contents. The blood is necessarily rendered
more fluid, and if previously in any degree
viscid, its circulation is quickened by its dilution.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>2. The Effects of the Solvent Properties of
Water.</b>—With the exception of air, water is
the most transient of all the elements received
into the body. It is eliminated by the skin, the
lungs, the kidneys, and the intestines. By its solvent
action, it dissolves the various poisonous products
of the disintegration of the tissues. The
volume of the blood being increased, more water
comes in contact with the debris contained in
any part, and, in consequence, the same undesirable
products are more perfectly removed. The
increased amount of excrementitious matter in
solution is brought in contact with the various
depurating organs, producing, notably, the following
results:—</p>

<p class='c007'>a. <i>An increase of the urinary excretion.</i> It
is an important fact that this increase does not
consist in the addition of water merely, or dilution,
but that there is also an increased amount
of <i>urea</i>, the chief excrementitious principle removed
from the blood by the kidneys.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>b. <i>An increase in the cutaneous excretion.</i>
Water-drinking is one of the most efficient means
of producing copious perspiration, which, as with
the urinary excretion, is not a mere elimination
of water, but is a real depurating process.</p>

<p class='c007'>c. <i>Increased action of the intestinal mucous
membrane.</i> Elimination from the mucous membrane
of the intestinal track, which is an important
organ of excretion, is also increased by drinking
freely of pure water. The result of this increased
action is not only to remove from the
blood some of its foulest constituents, but to render
more fluid the contents of the intestines, and
thus tend to obviate that almost universal accompaniment
of sedentary habits, constipation.</p>

<p class='c007'>The removal of clogging matters from the system
in this manner allows greater freedom of
vital action, so that the activities of the body are
quickened, and both waste and repair, disintegration
and assimilation, are accelerated.</p>

<p class='c007'>The use of water thus hastens all the vital
processes by increasing the change of tissue.
This result is of course chiefly obtained by employing
it as a drink. The experiments of Liebig
fully confirm this view. He expressly mentions
the free use of water as one of the means
of accelerating vital change. Prof. John B. Biddle,
M. D., in his “Materia Medica,” states that “it
promotes both the metamorphosis and construction
of tissue,” from which fact he attributes to
it valuable curative properties, as an alterative,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>when the removal of a morbid taint is desired, as
in certain venereal diseases.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>3. Effects resulting from the Modification of
Temperature.</b>—Perhaps the most important, certainly
the most common, effects of water upon
the living organism are those which result from
its modifications of the temperature of the body
in its various modes of application. These effects
vary greatly according to the temperature,
and the duration of the application. General
and local applications also differ in their results.</p>

<p class='c007'>It should be remarked that all of the effects of
water are really the results of the vital resistance
of the system in its attempts to remove abnormal
or unusual conditions, or to accommodate itself to
new circumstances.</p>

<p class='c007'>Baths are divided into six classes, according to
their temperature, as follows:—</p>

<table class='table1'>
  <tr>
    <td class='c009'>1. Cold,</td>

  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c007'>For the sake of simplicity, we will consider the
effects of water applications under three heads;
viz., cold, warm, and hot.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>The Cold Bath.</i>—Under this head we will consider
applications of all temperatures below 85°
F. Cold or cool water, applied to any portion of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>the body, causes instant contraction of the small
arteries of the part, through its influence upon
the sympathetic or vasomotor system of nerves.
So long as the application of the unusual temperature
is continued, the vascular contraction is
maintained, and the part seems nearly bloodless.
If the cold is below 33° F., and is long continued,
destruction of the tissues, by freezing, will result.</p>

<p class='c007'>If a moderately cool or cold temperature is
maintained for some time, the blood-vessels of the
part are more or less permanently contracted, and
the blood supply thus lessened. If, on the other
hand, the application is very brief, the contraction
of the vessels is only momentary, and is followed
by a proportionate degree of relaxation,
and a corresponding increase in the supply of
blood to the part.</p>

<p class='c007'>A very cold bath applied to any considerable
portion of the body, and continued more than a
very brief time, produces headache, dullness,
sometimes nausea and vomiting, loss of sensibility,
and other unpleasant and painful symptoms.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is thus seen that the effects of cold are quite
different—exactly opposite, in fact—as the application
is a prolonged, or a brief one. The long
application produces effects in some degree permanently
sedative, while the brief application is
followed by a momentary condition which may
be termed shock, and which is usually followed
very quickly by a reaction analogous to stimulation
when produced in any other manner.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span><i>Effect of Cold upon the Pulse.</i>—The experiments
of Drs. Currie, Bell, and others, show conclusively
that the cold bath has the uniform effect
of diminishing the frequency of the heart’s
action from ten to twenty beats in a minute below
the usual standard. Upon the first application
of cold, there is a slight increase in the rate
of pulsation; but this soon subsides, and is succeeded
by a marked diminution. The ultimate
effect is the same, whether the application is made
at its maximum degree of severity or not; but if
the application is first warm, being gradually reduced
in temperature, the result is reached without
the occurrence of the unpleasant shock, or
feeling of chilliness, which attends the sudden
application of cold, especially in persons of delicate
nervous sensibilities. The amount and after
duration of the diminished rate of pulsation depends
upon the temperature and duration of the
bath. In health, it does not commonly extend
beyond a few hours at most.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Effect of Cold upon Temperature.</i>—It was also
shown by the same experimenters that the temperature
of the body is reduced proportionately with
the action of the heart. The natural temperature,
as shown by a thermometer placed in the
axilla, is 98° F. During and after a cold bath,
the thermometer applied to the same part, indicates
from one-half a degree to five or six, or even
more, degrees, diminution of temperature. In
some cases the temperature continues to fall after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>the bath. The real temperature is lessened even
though the skin may glow, and may seem to possess
increased warmth. Cold and heat are, within
certain limits, wholly relative terms to the nerves
of sensibility. What is warm at one time may
be cold at another, though the temperature remains
the same. The same temperature may be
warm to one hand and cool to the other. Temperature
can only be <i>accurately</i> determined by
the thermometer.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Rationale of Effects of the Cold Bath.</i>—The
manner in which the cold bath produces the sedative
effects noted, is apparently simple. When
applied locally, to a single organ or part, it diminishes
the circulation in the part by occasioning
contraction of the muscular coats of the <i>arterioles</i>,
or small arteries. Their caliber being
thus lessened, they of course allow the passage of
less blood, and the circulation in the part is diminished.
There are, then, three causes for the
decrease of heat; viz.,—</p>

<p class='c007'>1. A portion of the heat of any part is brought
to it by the blood; the supply of blood being
lessened, the heat is diminished;</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Heat is produced by vital or chemical
changes which occur in the capillaries or their
immediate vicinity. These depend chiefly upon
the supply of oxygen, which, again, is largely regulated
by the blood supply; and it being lessened
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>with the blood, the amount of heat <i>produced</i> is
diminished.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. The water in contact with the part, being of
a lower temperature, abstracts heat from it as it
would from any other body of a higher temperature
than itself.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the application of cold water is more
general, being made to the whole body, or to a
considerable portion of it, the same effects are
produced on a larger scale. A large proportion
of the small arteries of the body, being brought
under the influence of cold, are made to contract,
thus directly lessening the circulation, and so diminishing,
also, the production of heat. Through
the sympathetic system, the same effect produced
upon the small arteries is produced also upon the
heart, lessening the rapidity of its contractions.
Again, it has been satisfactorily shown that the
action of the heart is largely controlled by the action
of the small arteries; so that we have abundant
explanation of the decrease in the rate of
pulsation. Finally, we have a cold fluid in contact
with a large portion of the body, abstracting
heat by conduction, as well as lessening its production.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus we see that water, when applied at a
proper temperature, is one of the most powerful
means of depressing the vital activities of the
body, diminishing circulation and animal heat as
will no other agent. The several modes for applying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>it are considered in another portion of this
work.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>The Hot Bath.</i>—We shall include under this
head applications of a temperature above 98° F.,
the mean temperature of the body. As with the
cold bath, the effects differ greatly according as
the application is brief or prolonged. Local and
general applications also differ in their effects.</p>

<p class='c007'>A brief local application causes an increase in
the circulation of a part which very closely resembles,
perhaps is identical with, active congestion.
The small arteries are distended, and the
vital activities and heat of the part are increased.
The several effects seem to be little different from
those resulting from the application of a mild
sinapism. The action of the vital instincts is defensive
in both cases.</p>

<p class='c007'>When applied to special organs, special effects
are produced. For instance, a hot fomentation
applied to the head for a few minutes will usually
produce drowsiness by diversion of a portion
of the blood supply of the brain to the skull and
scalp. Prolonged applications produce a more or
less permanent relaxation of the blood-vessels,
and consequent congestion.</p>

<p class='c007'>A hot bath applied to the whole body, or a
large portion of it, produces an acceleration of
the pulse and an increase of animal heat proportionate
to the temperature of the bath. A bath
at 106° to 108° F. will increase the pulse from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>the normal standard to one hundred or one hundred
and twenty beats in a minute, in a short
time. A bath four or five degrees hotter has
been known to increase the pulse to more than
one hundred and fifty beats in a minute.</p>

<p class='c007'>When a hot bath is prolonged, the face becomes
flushed, and the whole skin very red; the head
aches; sight is sometimes dimmed; ringing in the
ears, faintness, a stinging pain in the skin, and
intense desire to urinate are symptoms which are
often present. Copious perspiration and intense
congestion of the skin are constant effects. The
cutaneous congestion, from relaxation of the
blood-vessels, is apt to continue to exist after the
bath, if it is greatly prolonged, to the serious injury
of the subject.</p>

<p class='c007'>The effects of the vapor bath are essentially
the same as those described, though a somewhat
higher degree of heat is tolerated without injury.
In the hot-air bath, a still higher heat is borne
with impunity.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Rationale of Effects of the Hot Bath.</i>—It
scarcely need be repeated that all of the effects
noticed, as well as those of all other baths, are
chiefly the results of modifications of vital action
occasioned by the agent employed. The application
of heat to the body occasions relaxation of
the muscular coats of the small arteries, and increased
action of those vessels. No doubt this
is for the purpose of bringing moisture to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>surface to protect the tissues against the unnatural
heat. As is the case with cold baths, the
causes which modify the heat are three; viz.,—</p>

<p class='c007'>1. The increased quantity of blood circulating
through the part brings to it an increased amount
of heat;</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Increased vital and chemical action increases
the production of heat;</p>

<p class='c007'>3. The body absorbs heat from the surrounding
medium as any other colder object would do.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the general application of hot water or vapor,
effects similar to its local effects are produced
upon the whole surface of the body, involving,
also, to a considerable extent, the deeper
structures. The pulse is accelerated because the
small arteries are distended and more active, creating
a demand for a greater quantity of blood,
requiring an increase in the heart’s action. It
is also quite probable that the action of the heart
is somewhat quickened as the result of the influence
of heat upon the pneumogastric nerve which
controls it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The cerebral symptoms, faintness, etc., which
occur when heat is applied in excess, are the result
of the diversion of so large a proportion of the
blood into the superficial vessels. A prolonged
hot foot bath or leg bath will often produce faintness.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are few agents which will so rapidly
produce such powerfully excitant and stimulant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>effects as the hot bath. The painful and undesirable
results occasioned by its incautious use
are evidences of its power.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>The Warm Bath.</i>—In this connection we apply
the term warm to baths of a temperature
between 85° and 98° F., though baths of a temperature
between 85° and 92° would be more accurately
termed tepid, which term is applied to
baths of that temperature elsewhere than in this
immediate connection.</p>

<p class='c007'>The warm bath never exceeds the temperature
of the body, and is usually below it. Its effect
is uniformly to diminish the frequency of the
pulse and of respiration, and to decrease animal
heat. Its effects are the same as those of the
cool or cold bath, in this respect, but they differ
in several other particulars. Unlike the cold
bath, the warm bath is not accompanied by an
unpleasant shock, or chill, and, hence, is not followed
by reaction. It promotes the action of the
skin in a very marked degree, increasing both
perspiration and absorption. When continued
for an hour or two, the weight is appreciably
increased by the absorption of water. Its general
effects are very mild and soothing, often inclining
the patient to sleep.</p>

<p class='c007'>This bath seems to produce its effects not so
much by exciting the vital energies to abnormal
action or resistance, as by supplying the most
favorable conditions for the performance of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>natural and usual functions. This is doubtless
on account of its close approximation to the
temperature of the body. In this respect, if this
supposition be true, it differs from baths of a
temperature either much above or greatly below
the normal temperature of the body.</p>

<p class='c007'>The warm vapor bath produces effects quite
analogous to those of the warm water bath. Its
effect upon the processes of perspiration and absorption
is a little more marked, even with the
same degree of temperature. The results differ
somewhat, according as the whole body is enveloped,
so that the warm vapor is taken into
the lungs, or the head excluded. A more equable
effect is produced by including the whole body
in the bath, and no harm can result if the temperature
is not raised above that of the body, as
it should not be, in the <i>warm</i> bath.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Sympathetic Effects.</b>—There is scarcely room
for doubt that many of the effects of the various
kinds of water applications are wholly of a sympathetic
character. All portions of the body are
intimately associated together by a system of
nerves called the sympathetic system, from their
peculiar function. Certain portions, as the skin
and mucous membrane, are particularly related.
The large number of sensitive nerves which connect
the skin with the brain, bring it in peculiarly
close relations to that organ, and give additional
potency to any agent applied to so extensive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>a surface. The well-known fact that burns of
the skin are often the occasion of fatal ulceration
of the mucous membrane of the intestines sufficiently
attests the intimate relation between
these two tissues; while the effects upon the
skin of mental emotions, as of shame and of fear,
are conclusive evidence of the peculiar closeness
of relation between the cerebral and cutaneous
organs. The condition of the mind has much to
do with the effect of a bath.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Modes of Administration.</b>—There are numerous
modes of administering baths of all temperatures,
each of which produces some modification
of the general effect of the given temperature.
For example, such baths as the douche, the spray,
and the shower bath, are much more cooling in
their effects than a full bath at the same temperature;
since, in the latter case, nearly the whole
body would be submerged in a medium of equable
temperature, while in the case of the spray, etc.,
the body would be additionally cooled by the
rapid evaporation taking place upon its surface.
Many other peculiar effects are obtained by particular
modes of administration, which will be described
in their proper place.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>HISTORY OF WATER CURE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The utility of water as an agent in the treatment
of disease is not a modern discovery, as the
pretensions of some aspirants for notoriety have
led many to believe. A very cursory glance at
the history of various ancient nations furnishes
sufficient evidence that the use of the bath as a
curative agent was of very remote origin. The
works of the oldest medical authors contain numerous
references to the bath, recommendations
of its use in cases of disease, and testimonials of
its good effects when properly employed. As
this is a matter of some interest to many of those
who employ and advocate the use of water as
a remedial agent, as well as to those who are investigating
its merits, we shall devote a little
space to a sketch of the use and estimation of
the bath by various nations and tribes—civilized
and barbarous—and regular and irregular physicians,
from the remote ages of antiquity down to
modern times. For several of the facts presented
we are indebted to a valuable work by Dr. Bell,
long out of print and now somewhat rare.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Bath in Egypt.</b>—That bathing was practiced
to a considerable extent by the Egyptians
at a very early period, is evinced by both sacred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>and profane history. It was through obedience
to this custom that Moses was discovered among
the rushes by Pharaoh’s daughter as she went
down to the river side to bathe. Pictures discovered
in ancient Egyptian tombs represent persons
preparing for the bath. We have no expression
of the estimate which was placed upon the bath
as a remedial agent; but it is hardly possible to
believe that an agent held in such high esteem
as a preventive of disease should not be valued
as a useful remedy.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Bathing among the Jews.</b>—The code of laws
prepared by Moses, under divine instruction, for
the government of the Hebrew nation after its departure
from Egypt, made bathing a prominent
feature. The connection of the bath with the
treatment of leprosy would naturally lead to the
conclusion that it was employed for its curative
effects.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Persian Baths.</b>—The ancient Persians held the
bath in such high esteem that they erected magnificent
public structures devoted to bathing.
The baths of Darius are spoken of as especially
remarkable.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>The Bath among the Greeks.</b>—The cold bath
was employed among the Greeks. Lycurgus, the
famous Spartan legislator, prescribed its daily
use for all his subjects, not excepting the tendered
infants. In later times, the warm bath was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>introduced, and stately buildings were erected for
the accommodation of bathers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The learned Greek, Hippocrates, the father of
medical literature, and a very acute observer of
disease and the effects of various agents upon
the body, highly recommended the use of water
in many diseases, describing with great care the
proper mode of administering a simple bath.
He laid great stress upon the careful and skillful
use of the bath, asserting that, when improperly
applied, it, “instead of doing good, may rather
prove injurious.” His directions for the employment
of the bath were very discreet. He
very wisely remarks that those patients whose
symptoms are such as would be benefited by
bathing should be bathed, even though some of
the requisite conveniences may be wanting; while
those whose symptoms do not indicate the need
of this remedy, should not employ it, though all
the necessary appliances are at hand. He made
great use of water as a beverage in treating disease.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Roman Baths.</b>—The Romans excelled all other
nations in the sumptuousness of their bathing
arrangements. Their public baths were among
their greatest works of architecture, and were
supplied with every convenience for increasing
the utility and luxury of the bath. Kings and
emperors vied with each other in perfecting and
enlarging these sanitary institutions. Accommodations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>were provided, in some cases, for nearly
20,000 bathers employing the baths simultaneously;
and at one time the number of public baths
in Rome was nearly one thousand. Even Nero,
whose name has come down to us covered with
infamy, has the credit of doing at least one good
act in erecting a magnificent public bath, though
even the detergent effects of such an act can
hardly cleanse his character of the many foul
blots by which it is rendered odious.</p>

<p class='c007'>Celsus and Galen, two noted Latin physicians,
extolled the bath as an invaluable remedy, almost
two thousand years ago. The latter pronounced
the bath to be one of the essential features of a
system of perfect cure which he termed <i>apotheraphia</i>,
exercise and friction being the other essentials.
If the regular physicians of half a century
ago had followed the practice of Galen, as
described in his works, they would have refreshed
their languishing fever patients with cold water
as a beverage instead of leaving them to be consumed
by the pent-up fires which parched their
lips, disorganized their blood, and finally ended
their sufferings with their lives. Celsus was
proud to boast of employing the bath more frequently
and systematically than others had done
before his time.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Emperor Augustus was cured, by the bath,
of a disease which had baffled all other remedies.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span><b>Testimony of Arabian Physicians.</b> — Although
the Arabians are at the present day looked upon,
and justly, as a horde of wandering wild-men, a
thousand years ago their physicians were among
the most learned of the age; and they were as
sensible as learned, we judge, for they were most
enthusiastic advocates of the efficiency of the bath.
Rhazes, one of the most eminent of them, describes
a plan of treating small-pox and measles which
would scarcely be modified by the most zealous
advocate of water treatment at the present day.
Avicenna and Meshnes, with others, may be mentioned
as holding similar views.</p>

<p class='c007'>The bath was much used in pestilences by this
nation, and was largely employed in Constantinople
in the fifteenth century.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Modern Bathing Customs.</b>—Three centuries
ago, public vapor baths were very numerous in
Paris, being connected with barber shops, as are
many baths in this country at the present time.
According to Dr. Bell, Paris can still boast of a
great number of bathing establishments. He
states that in the baths connected with the city
hospitals nearly 130,000 thousand baths were administered
in a single year to out-door patients.
Doubtless those treated in the hospitals were duly
washed and steamed as well. This is certainly a
very marked contrast with what we see in the
hospitals in this country at the present day.
Notwithstanding the advances in many other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>particulars of hospital management, the cuticles
of patients are sadly neglected. In some of our
largest hospitals, the filthiness of many patients
is so great that close proximity to them is absolutely
intolerable. Half a dozen of them, placed
in a warm room, speedily impart to the air a fetor
unequaled by anything but the effluvia arising
from a neglected pig-sty. Such neglect is
inexcusable.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Germans of olden time were very fond of
bathing, according to their historical records, and
during the Middle Ages, when plagued by the leprosy,
the national faith in the virtues of the bath
was manifested by making it a religious duty. It
is related of Charlemagne that he used to hold
his court in a huge warm bath. Modern Teutons
seem less partial to the bath, having transferred
their fondness from <i>aqua pura</i> to lager beer.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although the bath was very freely used in
England while the island was occupied by the
Romans, who erected commodious baths like
those in Rome, the wholesome practice is now
sadly neglected by the English people, if we may
credit their own writers.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is a curious fact that the bath seems to be
quite generally neglected by the most civilized
races, while it is almost universally employed by
those less advanced nations, the Russians, Turks,
Finlanders, and the inhabitants of Persia, Egypt,
Barbary, and Hindostan. The Finlanders make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>great use of the sweating bath. To nearly every
house is attached a small sweat-house, where they
subject themselves to a temperature of more than
160° F., often emerging at once into an atmosphere
much below freezing, with apparent impunity.
The Turkish and Russian baths, similar to
which are those in use in Egypt and India, are
elsewhere described.</p>

<p class='c007'>The North American Indians employ the bath
for many diseases. They have original and peculiar
ways of administering both water and vapor
baths. The most common bath among them is the
vapor, followed by a plunge into a neighboring
stream. They generate the steam by pouring
water upon hot stones while they are inclosed in
a small, close hut made of mud or skins. The
native Mexicans secure a hot-air bath by confining
themselves in a brick sweat-house which is
heated by a furnace outside. These savages seem
to have the most implicit confidence in the efficacy
of the bath, always employing it when ill,
and with excellent success.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Modern Medical Use of Water.</b>—In the early
part of the eighteenth century, a Sicilian
named Fra Bernado acquired the title of “coldwater
doctor” from his exclusive use of cold water
in treating the sick.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the very beginning of the eighteenth century,
Floyer published a history of bathing which
contains accounts of many remarkable cures effected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>by means of the bath, which he recommended
as a most efficient cure for numerous
diseases.</p>

<p class='c007'>A Mr. Hancock, a clergyman, published, in
1722, a tract entitled, “Common Water the Best
Cure of Fevers.” Another writer, in a work entitled,
“The Curiosities of Common Water,” published
in 1723, speaks of water as an “excellent
remedy which will perform cures with very little
trouble, and without any charge,” and “may be
truly styled, an universal remedy.” Both French
and German writers were zealously advocating
the use of water as a remedy for many diseases
at this same period. Many of the French surgeons
had also discovered the immense utility of
water in surgery, receiving their first lessons of
instruction from an ignorant and superstitious
miller, who used water in conjunction with
charms.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the latter part of the last century, Drs. Jackson
and Currie each published reports of cases of
fever in which they had found the use of the bath
a remedy of remarkable efficacy. Dr. Currie obtained
many followers for a time, but no very
deep impression was made upon the public mind,
though his cases were authentic, and were very
ably reported.</p>

<p class='c007'>About the end of the first quarter of the present
century, a native of Græfenberg, Prussia, by
the name of Priessnitz, met with an accident by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>which three of his ribs were broken. He treated
himself by applications of cold water, and then
tried the same remedy upon others in similar
cases. His success encouraged him to make further
experiments, and though an ignorant peasant,
his natural acuteness enabled him to devise
various means for applying water to the body,
and to suit the application to different diseases.
His increasing success attracted numerous patients,
and his fame became, in a few years, worldwide.
Many of his methods were very rude, and
his ignorance of medical science often led him into
errors; but he succeeded in restoring to health
hundreds of patients whose maladies had been
pronounced incurable.</p>

<p class='c007'>The interest in the new method became so
great that numerous other individuals, equally ignorant
and possessing less shrewdness, undertook
to imitate the German innovator. Some of them
were successful, many of them were not; all were
alike in committing numerous blunders through
ignorance of scientific medicine. But the public
attention was called to the utility of water as a
remedial agent so forcibly that a powerful impression
was produced in its favor. From that
time until the present, the use of water has been
largely in the hands of unscientific empirics who
have advocated it as a specific, and employed it
to the exclusion of other remedies in a great degree.
This course, together with many other gross
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>errors connected with the practice, has deterred
scientific physicians from employing it sufficiently
to test its merits, only in a few exceptional instances.</p>

<p class='c007'>The friends of Priessnitz claimed for him a
great discovery; but as we have seen, he discovered
nothing which was not known a century before,
if not, indeed, some thousands of years previous.
It is doing Priessnitz no injustice to say
that he did little or nothing toward establishing
principles, but followed, chiefly, a routine method
of practice.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some scientific members of the medical profession
have investigated the subject in some degree,
however, at various times, and the result
has been that at the present day the utility of
water is a well-recognized fact, and it is now
often prescribed in the standard text-books as an
excellent remedy for many diseased conditions.
Yet, that there is still a want of appreciation of
the remedy is fully attested by the infrequency
of its use by the regular profession. This neglect
may be due in part to a prejudice which the
members of the regular profession have acquired,
on account of the quackery which has too often
been connected with the use of this remedy.
Nevertheless, there is no good reason why an efficient
remedial agent should be suffered to receive
the stigma which properly attaches only to those
who are responsible for its abuse.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>REMEDIAL PROPERTIES.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The value of a drug is judged by its medicinal
properties. The more properties it has, and the
more powerful its “action,” the more valuable it
is considered to be. We need not here enter into
a discussion of the nature of medicinal properties,
since there is no question among scientific
physicians, that the medicinal properties—so-called—of
drugs, or their effects upon the human
system in diseases, are, in general, the result of
vital resistance on the part of the system, an attempt
to expel or remove the poison, or defend
itself against it. Water also possesses remedial
properties, some of which are due to vital resistance,
while others grow out of the aid which it
affords the vital organs by its physical properties.
As its value as a curative agent depends upon
these properties, it is important to know what
they are.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Refrigerant.</i>—Refrigerant or antiphlogistic
medicines are used for the purpose of diminishing
the heat of the body. The most they can do is
to so depress and paralyze the vital forces as to
diminish the <i>production</i> of animal heat. Water,
when applied at a proper temperature—any temperature
less than 98°—not only diminishes the
production of heat, but removes the superfluous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>heat by conduction. There is not a drug in the
whole materia medica that will diminish the temperature
of the body so readily and so efficiently
as water. How this is effected, has been previously
explained in considering the physiological
effects of water.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Sedative.</i>—Drugs, the administration of which
is followed by a diminished action of the heart,
are termed sedatives. They comprise the most
powerful poisons known. Their sedative effects
are the result of their poisonous influence upon
the heart or the nerve centers controlling it.
Water is a much more efficient sedative, and its
use is never followed by poisonous effects, as is
the use of sedative drugs, the “action” of which
is often very uncertain. By the cool or cold bath,
the pulse may often be reduced twenty to forty
beats in a few minutes.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Tonic.</i>—Water may be used in such a way as
to increase the rapidity of the circulation and the
temperature very quickly and powerfully. The
hot bath is a most efficient stimulant, in the true
sense of the word. It will so excite the circulation
as to increase the pulse from seventy to one
hundred and fifty in fifteen minutes. The tonic
effects of a cool bath are well appreciated by all
who have ever enjoyed it.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Anodyne.</i>—Certain drugs are called anodyne
because they diminish nervous sensibility, thus
relieving pain. Water applied in the form of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>hot fomentation will not infrequently give relief
when every drug has failed. Applied in various
other ways, it is very effectual in allaying nervous
irritability.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Antispasmodic.</i>—No remedy is so certainly
successful in hysterical convulsions as water. In
infantile convulsions, its success is also unrivaled.
In cramp, and even in puerperal convulsions, its
utility has been well demonstrated.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Astringent.</i>—The value of cold water in arresting
hemorrhage is well attested by all physicians.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Laxative.</i>—Used in various ways, water is
very effectual in producing movement of the
bowels, but never occasions those violent and unpleasant
symptoms which accompany and succeed
the use of purgatives.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Emetic.</i>—In the great majority of cases, no
other emetic is needed, and no better can be
found.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Eliminative.</i>—Water is a most perfect eliminative.
It dissolves the excrementitious and
other foreign elements of the blood, and thus materially
aids in their elimination. Hence, it is a
very useful <i>diaphoretic</i>, increasing the action of
the skin, and is equally valuable as a <i>diuretic</i>,
having the same effect upon the kidneys.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Alterative.</i>—For a long period, mercury has
been considered as the champion alterative of the
materia medica. It must yield the place to water,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>however; for the most it can do is to destroy
the elements of the blood, while water not only
accelerates waste, but increases construction in
the same proportion, according to the experiments
of Prof. Liebig.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Derivative.</i>—One of the most important properties
of water applications is their powerful derivative
effect. No other application, internal or
external, can equal them in efficiency and certainty
of action.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are very few agents which possess so
many remedial properties as water. There are
none which effect so much with so little expense
to the vital powers of the patient. Many drugs
will produce results similar to those obtained by
the use of water, and thus accomplish good, no
doubt; but at the same time, they often work so
much mischief in the system that the evil done
is frequently much greater than the good accomplished.
The aim of the faithful physician should
be to accomplish for his patient the greatest
amount of good at the least expense of vitality;
and it is an indisputable fact that in a large number
of cases water is just the agent with which
this desirable end can be obtained.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Testimony of Eminent Physicians.</b>—The testimonies
of Currie, Jackson, and numerous
other physicians of the last century have already
been quoted in favor of water. There are numerous
practitioners of the present day who are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>equally favorable to this remedial agent. Perhaps
we cannot do better than to quote from the
<i>Health Reformer</i> the following paragraphs of an
abstract report of a paper read before the New
York Academy of medicine, by Prof. Austin
Flint, M. D., president of the society, the title of
the paper being, “The Researches of Currie, and
Recent Views Concerning the Use of Cold
Water”:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Currie employed scientific methods in observing
the phenomena of disease. He was one of
the first to employ the thermometer in studying
disease, and his observations can be received as
reliable.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The use of water externally as a means of
reducing the temperature of the body in disease
has recently been coming quite prominently into
notice. According to Liebermeister, a noted
German medical author, Currie was the first to
systematize the use of water. His work was
published in 1797. Liebermeister, in his recent
article on typhoid fever, accords to cold water
the first place in importance as an article for reducing
the temperature. The use of water for
this purpose is at present attracting much attention;
and it is safe to predict that <i>it will soon
occupy an important place as a remedial agent</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Much harm has been done by the ‘rude empiricism’
of Priessnitz, and the various water
cures in the country; though much good has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>also been accomplished by the latter institutions,
and they have in a measure prepared the public
mind for the general introduction of water as a
remedial agent.</p>

<p class='c007'>“After the publication of the views of Currie
in 1797, his method of practice, which was chiefly
hydropathic, became quite general, but it was
soon nearly forgotten. Trousseau recommended
water treatment in scarlatina, and the use of the
remedy has continued to be recommended in the
text-books; but as a measure of treatment in
practice, it has become nearly obsolete. It is,
however, obvious that unless we accept the absurd
proposition that diseases have changed since
Currie’s time, the remedy which he recommended
so highly must be just as efficient now as then.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dr. Currie made use of the cold douche in
fevers, applying it vigorously to the patient while
in the height of the fever, and continuing it until
the temperature became decreased, as indicated
by the thermometer and the pulse. He treated
seven cases of continued fever by this method
at the Liverpool Infirmary. All recovered. In
an epidemic of typhoid fever among a regiment
of troops, he treated fifty-eight cases, using the
cool tepid douche in all but two cases. The latter
died. The remaining fifty-six recovered, the
disease being greatly shortened in more than half
the cases.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dr. Currie asserted that, in small-pox, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>use of the bath afforded instant relief to the patient,
and caused the disease to assume a benignant
form.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He found the cold bath always effectual in
tetanus and convulsions, as also in hysteria.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In temporary insanity from the use of liquor,
this acute observer found that the cold plunge
was the most efficient remedy for the worst cases.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But Dr. Currie’s practice was not confined to
<i>cold</i> water. He observed that affusion with tepid
water was not only a more pleasant application,
but that it was even more effectual in reducing
unnatural heat than cold water, as it produced
no reaction, not being at all stimulating
in character.</p>

<p class='c007'>“With regard to the efficacy of this agent, Dr.
Currie stated that by its use in fevers the pulse
would be reduced thirty or forty beats, with a
corresponding decrease of temperature and almost
immediately relief of headache.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In his second volume, published some six
years after his first volume, Dr. Currie declared
that although his experience in the use of water,
especially in fevers, had been very extensive, he
had had only four fatal cases in which water was
employed, and had never met with a single evidence
of its being in the least degree objectionable
or injurious. Neither had he found that it
had been thought to be objectionable by those
whom he had treated. He details a very interesting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>account of his treatment of scarlatina in
the cases of his two sons, aged, respectively, three
and five years. He gave the older, in thirty-two
hours, fourteen affusions, varying from cold to
tepid. Twelve were found to be sufficient for
the younger one. Both became convalescent in
three days.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was established by Currie that by the use
of water the course of typhoid fever may be abbreviated.
This is not even claimed for the
modern remedies in common use.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In referring to his own experience in the use
of water, Dr. F. remarked, ‘The relation of my
own experience will of necessity be stated in a
few words, as my employment of the remedy
has heretofore been much more limited than it
will be in the future if my life is spared.’ He
then related some very interesting cases in which
he had employed water as the chief remedy with
the most excellent success. He also took occasion
to recommend, as one of the best means of
applying water in fevers, the wet-sheet pack as
employed in the various hydropathic institutions
of the country. He had used the continued cold
pack in a number of the worst cases of sun-stroke
in Bellevue Hospital with marked success. This
remedy is still employed there in this class of
cases.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In a case of obstinate remittent fever, which
was not in the least benefited by the thorough
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>use of quinia, he employed the cool pack thirty-five
times in a week, continuing each application
from ten to thirty minutes, and always with great
relief to the patient, although he finally died [perhaps
from the huge doses of quinine previously given].
He expressed the opinion that if he had employed
the pack more thoroughly, making the applications
longer and more frequent, the patient
might have recovered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Currie announced a true theory when he said
that <i>the voice of nature should not be superseded
by theories</i>. He advocated the free use of water
as a beverage in febrile diseases [fever] as an important
remedial agent. Dr. F. unhesitatingly
advanced the belief that the chief benefit derived
from the numerous mineral waters so largely used
was only that which was due to the properties
of pure water. He stated as proof that it was
not long since demonstrated by chemical analysis
that the only thing peculiar about the water
of a certain spring, famous for medicinal virtues,
was its remarkable purity. He also suggested
the introduction of distilled water for cooking
and drinking purposes as a necessary sanitary
measure.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dr. F. then related a remarkable case of acute
inflammation of the kidneys in which the patient
exhibited the characteristic symptoms of poisoning
from the retention of urea. After other remedies
were tried in vain, the patient’s life was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>saved by the simple administration of water as a
beverage at short intervals. The diuretic effects
of the water soon washed away the poison and
gave immediate relief.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“After the conclusion of the paper, by Dr.
Flint, the venerable Dr. Richards arose and gave
his experience in the use of water. His ideas of
hydropathy were obtained when he has a young
man, from Dr. Currie’s works. He adopted the
practice of Dr. C. at that time in an epidemic of
typhoid fever, and with such remarkable success
as to astonish old practitioners. He stated that
he had cured more than one hundred cases of obstinate
constipation by simply directing the patient
to drink a glass of cold water half an hour
before breakfast, each morning. In one of these
cases the patient had not had a natural passage
from the bowels for a number of years; but he
was effectually cured, by the simple remedy mentioned,
in the course of a few months.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dr. Loyle gave an interesting resumé of ten
years’ experience in the use of water, with uniform
success, especially in convulsions and scarlatina.
He had employed water alone in about
one hundred cases of acute inflammation of the
kidneys and dropsy after scarlatina, and with
wonderful success in every case. He had found
it equally successful in coma, restoring consciousness
when life was apparently extinct. During
the late war, he on one occasion renovated twenty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>ambulance loads of exhausted soldiers who had
fallen on the march, by the judicious use of water.
He recommended water most highly as an excellent
diuretic and a capital regulator of the bowels,
far superior to ‘after-dinner pills.’ He commended
it also as an efficient remedy for sun-stroke
and frozen feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The sentiment of the audience—which was
wholly composed of medical gentlemen—was
shown by the hearty applause with which the
remarks of each speaker were received.”</p>

<p class='c007'>We might add much other medical testimony;
but as we could give no higher authority than the
distinguished Dr. Flint, who stands at the head
of medical practice in America, being author of
the standard American text-book on practical
medicine, we will not weary the reader with further
quotations. The German physicians, as well
as German medical works, abound with tributes
to the value of water. American medical journals
are full of accounts of the beneficial results
following its use in fevers and numerous other
diseased conditions.</p>

<p class='c007'>In surgery, the employment of water is rapidly
gaining entire precedence. It has replaced nearly
all other kinds of dressing for wounds, and its
use has saved a valuable limb to many a poor sufferer
who must otherwise have submitted to amputation.</p>

<p class='c007'>In short, wherever it is faithfully and intelligently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>applied, water is working wonders. Yet
it is still little used in comparison with its importance.
Especially is its use neglected in
chronic diseases. The only reason we have been
able to discover for this neglect of a remedy, the
merits of which are so well demonstrated and
generally acknowledged, is that its use is more
troublesome and laborious than the use of drugs.
A half-dozen purgative pills are administered
much more easily than an enema. The administration
of a diaphoretic powder is far more convenient
than a pack. A blister is easier to manage
than a fomentation. But the true physician, who
has at heart the real good of his patient, will not
sacrifice the safety or comfort of the latter to his
own personal convenience.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>ERRORS IN WATER CURE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Much of the prejudice against the use of water
in treating disease has grown out of abuses of
the remedy, and the putting forward of absurd
claims by ignorant persons professing to understand
its use. In order to vindicate the character
of this powerful curative agent, it is necessary
to expose the errors and ignorance of those
who have abused it.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>“Cold Water Doctors.”</b>—In the early days of
the modern water cure practice, which was very
largely introduced by Priessnitz, cold water was
the universal remedy. No matter what the nature
of the disease, or the condition or temperament
of the patient, the remedy was the same.
At the establishment of the Græfenberg doctor,
ice-cold douches, precipitated from a height of sixteen
to eighteen feet, the plunge, directly supplied
by the cold mountain springs, and the shower
bath of the same temperature, were all administered
to patients with little discrimination of modifying
circumstances, in rooms unwarmed by artificial
heat, even in the depths of the coldest mountain
winters. As Græfenberg was the source
whence most water doctors of that time drew their
knowledge, the same practice was pursued elsewhere.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>The unreasonableness of such a course
was perceived by the more judicious, and thus
its influence was prejudicial.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Heroic Treatment.</b>—Such treatment as that
described in the preceding paragraph could not
result otherwise than disastrously in numerous
cases. The evil effects were sometimes seen at
once, but more frequently they appeared after
periods more or less remote. In some cases, patients
were led to drink twenty or thirty glasses
of cold water before breakfast, under the absurd
doctrine that the evils of a small excess would be
cured by greater indulgence. Hundreds of persons
adopted the practice of daily bathing in cold
water in a cold room, even in the coldest weather.
A few even went so far as to spring from their
warm beds on the coldest mornings, run to a
neighboring brook in a state of nudity, and
plunge into its frigid waters through a hole in the
ice. So infatuated were these enthusiasts, they
really thought they enjoyed this refrigerating
process; but, generally, a few years’ continuance
of it was sufficient to produce such a “sedative”
effect upon their systems that some became the
victims of consumption and other constitutional
diseases, while others were compelled to discontinue
the practice from absolute inability to continue
it. A few of the more vigorous were enabled
to survive this violent treatment without apparent
injury for a long time; but those of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>weaker vital powers soon showed the results of
its evil effects.</p>

<p class='c007'>By such processes, together with the cold sitz
bath, the dry pack, and other harsh measures, the
patient was sometimes brought to the very verge
of the grave.</p>

<p class='c007'>Strange as it may appear, those who have been
the strongest opponents of the use of water,
themselves afford the best instances of its excessive
use. For instance, in a case of low typhus
fever, a “regular” physician ordered the patient,
a young woman, to be immersed in cold water for
half an hour. The attendants attempted to carry
out the prescription, but in a few moments her
symptoms became so alarming that the patient
was removed from the bath. It will not be considered
remarkable that she died. A prominent
New York physician, a professor of practice in
one of the largest medical colleges in America, in
a report of a case of remittent fever which he
had treated with water, said that he administered
thirty-five cold packs in a week. The patient
died; but the doctor thought that if he had been
more thorough in his treatment, giving more
packs and longer ones, he would have lived. Another
professor, of a rival college in the same
city, cited, in a public lecture, a case of pneumonia
which was treated hydropathically by a regular
physician of note. The patient, while very
feeble, was placed in a cold bath. He was taken
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>out shivering, and died an hour afterward. His
conclusion was that water was a very hazardous
remedy. We would certainly agree with the
professor’s conclusion if the case cited were an
example of the <i>proper</i> use of water. In the preceding
case, we will not say that the packs were
not beneficial; but if they had been thus used
by a professed hydropathist, the treatment would
have been pronounced decidedly heroic by “regulars.”</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Crisis.</b>—By the violent processes which have
been mentioned, the patient was frequently
brought into a condition similar to that produced
by the old process of depletion by bleeding,
antimony, mercury, and purgatives. Painful
skin eruptions, boils, and carbuncles, often covered
the whole body. Acute pains racked the
body of the patient from head to foot. If he
survived this “crisis,” he usually got well, which
was regarded as an evidence of the salutary effect
of the crisis, and so it became an important
object to be attained; and the worse a patient
felt, the more certain and speedy, he was encouraged
to believe, would be his recovery. No account
was taken of the immense waste of vital
energy during these painful morbid processes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The use of the abdominal bandage, continued
for a long time until an eruption is produced, is
another means by which some have sought to effect
a cure of their patients. This course is pursued
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>under the belief that the discharge occurring
from the surface which thus becomes diseased is
a vicarious means of removing impurities from
the system—an absurd notion which no one acquainted
with the first principles of physiology
and surgical pathology could entertain for a moment.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Hydropathic Quacks.</b>—Unfortunately for the
reputation of water as a remedy, its use has
been largely in the hands of empirics who have
used it in a routine manner, and have supposed
it to be a cure-all, and the only remedy of any
value. At least, such have been the claims made
for it. This has served to bring it into disrepute,
the disgrace which ought to attach to individuals
being applied by an undiscriminating public to
the innocent victim of abuse.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Ignorance.</b>—The greatest bane of all has been
the ignorance of those who have professed to
be qualified to administer water as a remedy
understandingly. Priessnitz himself was an ignorant
peasant. He was innocent of either anatomical
or surgical knowledge. His slight acquaintance
with physiology was gathered by
cursory observations of patients. Of the effects
of water he knew more, studying them with a
good degree of acuteness. His lamentable want
of knowledge allowed him to fall into many errors.
It is related of him that he treated hopeless
cases of solid anchylosis of joints just as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>though they were mere cases of stiffness from
rheumatism. Cases of hopeless organic disease,
he pronounced curable and submitted to long but
unavailing treatment, not knowing the real nature
of the disease. A young lady died of what
he supposed an internal abscess. No abscess was
found, upon which he remarked that “she had
too short a neck for long life.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It could be no wonder, then, that the disciples
of such a master should be sadly lacking in many
of those qualifications essential for a successful
physician, no matter what the remedies employed.
The most lamentable feature of the matter is that
the same ignorance has continued to be, with few
exceptions, characteristic of those who have employed
water as a remedy; this has been especially
disastrous because a man with the native
shrewdness and acuteness of perception of Priessnitz
has rarely appeared in the ranks of hydropathists.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>A Popular Error.</b>—It is a grievous popular
error that any one can apply water as skillfully
as the most experienced physician, and that
its successful use requires no knowledge of the
structure and functions of the human body. No
doubt this has grown out of another error, perhaps
quite as common; viz., that water is so simple
a remedy that it will do no harm if it does no
good. Such notions have frequently led to most
disastrous results. Water, as already shown, is one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>of the most powerful remedies. And while it is,
undoubtedly, far safer in the hands of the uneducated
than blisters, purgatives, diuretics, and
such agents as opium, chloral, alcohol, and most
other drugs, yet it certainly requires careful usage,
and the more scientific knowledge the user
possesses, the more skillfully will he be able to
apply it. It is, furthermore, true that a great
majority of ordinary diseases are commonly so
void of danger under careful nursing and hygienic
management that the application of water is
a simple matter which any intelligent mother can
perform successfully. A case is related by good
authority of a person who fell in apoplexy an
hour after taking an excessively hot bath. Another
patient became a paralytic from the same
cause. Water is a remedy which cannot be safely
used by one who has not informed himself of its
effects, and of the proper modes of application.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Absurd Claims.</b>—Sensible people have been
rightfully disgusted with the claims which have
been made by certain pretentious ones for the use
of water. One declares that the bath will dissolve
out of the body mineral substances which have
been taken into it. Another claims to have been
able, by the application of fomentations to a
rheumatic knee, to extract in regular order the
ointments which had previously been successively
applied. Numerous other claims equally preposterous
might be related, if it were necessary.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>They have all tended to excite a feeling of contempt
for a means of treating disease which is
really worthy of the highest estimation.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Neglect of Other Remedies.</b>—As has been previously
remarked, many seem to have forgotten
that water is not the only remedy for disease, and
not only attempt to cure every disease by its application,
but use it to the exclusion of all other
remedies. In nearly all cases, sunlight, pure air,
rest, exercise, proper food, and other hygienic
agencies are quite as important as water. Electricity,
too, is a remedy which should not be ignored;
and skillful surgery is absolutely indispensable
in not a small number of cases. Even
drugs are sometimes useful auxiliaries, though,
doubtless, infinitely more harm has resulted from
the employment of drugs in conjunction with
water treatment than from their omission.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Rational Hydropathy</i> leaves room for every
other remedy of value. It does not regard water
as a specific nor as a panacea, but only as one of
the most valuable of numerous excellent remedies.
It discards the erroneous and harmful
practices of empirics and ignorant charlatans,
whether they concern water or other agents, and
gives to the aqueous element only its due share
of importance.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>APPLICATIONS OF WATER.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The indications which are to be met in the
treatment of disease are chiefly those enumerated
below; and how admirably they are met by applications
of water may be easily demonstrated
by following the directions given.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>1. Equalization of Circulation.</b>—Disease cannot
exist without some disturbance of the circulation.
In perfect health each part receives
its due share of blood. One of the first indications
in disease, then, is to balance the circulation.
If an organ contains too much blood,
the application of cold water to the part will occasion
contraction of the minute vessels of the
part, and thus the amount of blood is lessened, as
explained more at length in considering the physiological
effects of water.</p>

<p class='c007'>Or, the part may be relieved by the application
of warm water in some form to adjacent or
remote parts of the body, by which means the
surplus blood will be drawn to other parts, thus
relieving the suffering organ. Again, if an organ
contains too little blood, the opposite course
must be pursued. Warm or hot applications are
made to the part, while cold applications may be
made to other parts if necessary. Very often the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>two remedies may be advantageously combined,
since one part cannot contain too much blood
without some other part or parts being deprived
of the due proportion, and <i>vice versa</i>; so that
while a cold application is needed at one part,
the opposite is required at another.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>2. Regulation of Temperature.</b>—As the condition
of the bodily temperature is closely associated
with that of the circulation, the two are
usually controlled by the same remedies applied
in the same manner. A part which contains too
much blood has usually, also, too high a degree of
heat. The cold application relieves both. If the
entire surface of the body is involved, the application
must be as extensive as necessary to affect
the whole. In general fevers, the admirable
adaptation of water to this end is well exhibited.
When the temperature of the body rises above
100°, or even above 98°, a cooling bath should be
resorted to. It may consist of a simple sponging
with water, scarcely below the bodily temperature,
an affusion with tepid water, a full bath of
a tepid, temperate, or cold temperature, or some
other form of cooling application according to
the degree of cooling effect desired. Any temperature
below 98° will be cooling. In general,
it is better to employ a bath only a few degrees
below the bodily temperature, as its application
will not be followed by an increase of heat, called
reaction, which follows a brief application of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>a cool bath. To obtain the proper cooling effects
of a cool or cold bath, it must be continued for
some time, from ten minutes to half an hour, at
least. The same remark applies also to the application
of cool baths for the purpose of equalizing
the circulation.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>3. Removal of Pain.</b>—Pain is usually dependent
upon disturbance of the circulation, being
caused by the pressure of overfilled vessels upon
the nerves in a confined space. Pain may be
relieved by either hot or cold applications. The
first object should be to remove the surplus blood,
by local cold applications, and remote hot ones. If
this plan is not successful, relief will be obtained
by a hot local application, which operates by relaxing
the surrounding tissues, so that the nerve
fibers are relieved from pressure, as well as by
quickening the local circulation, and so relieving
congestion. The latter method is usually most
quickly successful; but it is not so radically curative
as the former. Pain dependent on passive
congestion will be best relieved by the method
next described.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>4. To Excite Activity.</b>—Many organs often
become torpid or inactive, as the skin and
liver, especially. Sometimes the blood-vessels of
an organ become relaxed and inactive, passive
congestion resulting. No remedy will so readily
induce a return of activity to the affected parts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>as alternate hot and cold applications, continued
for some minutes, fifteen to thirty or more. This
is one of the best applications for the relief of
old pains.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>5. Removal of Obstructions.</b>—A very large
class of diseases are attributable to obstruction in
various organs, caused by the reception of foreign
matters into the system, and the accumulation of
the natural waste of the tissues. The warm
bath, to remove, external obstructions, and the internal
use of water as a solvent for internal
sources of obstruction, are the remedies which
will achieve success in nearly all cases. Offending
substances in the stomach are readily removed
by the water emetic; and hardened accumulations
in the large intestine are removed with
equal facility by means of the enema.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>6. Dilution of the Blood.</b>—In fevers, cholera,
and other diseases, the blood often becomes
abnormally thickened, dark, and viscid, circulating
with difficulty, and not imparting due
nourishment to the tissues. Nothing but water
can remedy this difficulty. It may be got into
the blood by absorption from the skin, if the mucous
membrane of the stomach will not absorb it.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>7. Influence on the Nervous System.</b>—Finally,
it is often important to affect certain organs
through their nervous centers. Water, properly
applied, will accomplish this also. A fomentation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>applied to the abdomen will often remove
headache, and is an excellent remedy for
general nervousness, seeming to affect the whole
system, just as does galvanic electricity when applied
to the same locality, doubtless through the
large nervous ganglia located in that region.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some physicians claim to have obtained peculiar
results by the application of heat or cold to
the spine. It is said, for example, that cold applied
to any portion of the spine will produce an
increased circulation in the portion of the body
supplied with organic nerves from the part. Hot
applications to the spine are said to produce a contrary
effect upon corresponding organs. Perhaps
there should be still further observations upon this
subject before any attempt is made to establish
a definite law. It is well known that applications
of ice to the spine is an excellent remedy for
chorea, and several other nervous diseases.</p>

<p class='c007'>For general nervous irritability, or nervousness,
the <i>warm</i> full bath may be applied with
uniform success. Neither hot nor cold applications
are generally useful in such cases.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>Temperature of Baths.</b>—The thermometer is
the only accurate measure of temperature; hence
the importance of its use in the administration of
baths. Yet the thermometer may be abused. A
given temperature may seem warm to one individual
and tepid or cool to another. The same
difference of sensation will occur in the same individual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>on different occasions. What seems cool
to-day will be thought warm to-morrow. The
susceptibility of the body to sensations of heat
and cold largely depends upon its condition and
the temperature of surrounding objects. In consequence
of this physiological fact, it is improper
to attempt, as some have done, to fix certain exact
temperatures at which baths must be given to all
persons under all conditions.</p>

<p class='c007'>For convenience and perspicuity, the temperatures
of baths have been divided into six grades,
as given in the following table by Forbes; all
who attempt to use the bath according to the directions
should carefully learn and preserve the
distinctions here made:—</p>

<table class='table1'>

    <td class='c014'>112°</td>
    <td class='c016'>&#160;</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c007'>The vapor bath ranges from 98° to 120°; the
hot-air or Turkish bath from 100° to 160°, or
even higher, though not usefully so.</p>

<p class='c007'>A bath of any temperature above the natural
heat of the body, 98°, is a hot bath. At 32°,
water becomes ice; a bath is very rarely given at
this temperature, and then the application should
be made to only a small surface. Water at 32°,
and even ice and snow, may be usefully employed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>as topical remedies in local diseases. It will rarely
be necessary to employ a full bath at a lower
temperature than 65°, which will usually seem
very cold to the patient. A temperature from
85° to 95° is the most generally useful for baths
which involve a considerable portion of the body,
though of course higher temperatures are employed
in local applications.</p>

<p class='c007'><b>How to Determine the Temperature of a Bath
without a Thermometer.</b>—It is often necessary
to administer a bath when a thermometer cannot
be obtained. In such cases it is customary
to test the temperature by placing the hand
in the water. This is an unreliable method,
however; for the hand becomes, by usage, so
obtuse to heat that water which would seem
only warm to it would be painfully hot to the
body of the patient. To avoid this source of
error, it is only necessary to plunge the arm to
the elbow into the water, by which means its
real temperature will be determined. Water
which causes redness of the skin is hot; when it
feels simply comfortable, with no special sensation
of either heat or cold, it is warm. Slightly cooler
than this, it is tepid. When it causes the appearance
of goose-flesh, it may be for practical purposes
called cool, a still lower degree being cold.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Another Method.</i>—The method about to be described
is somewhat more accurate than the preceding,
and may be found convenient for facilitating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>the preparation of a bath of proper quantity
as well as temperature, a matter which though
simple enough is often quite annoying to inexperienced
persons. It is a fact of common knowledge
that water boils at 212° F. Boiling water,
then, is always of this temperature. Well and
spring water, and the water of cisterns in winter,
does not vary greatly from 53°. The temperature
of well and spring water changes very slightly with
the seasons. By combining in proper quantities
water of these known temperatures, any required
temperature may be produced. Not having seen
this method suggested before, we have prepared
the following table, which may perhaps be used
to advantage in the absence of a thermometer;
we advise all to obtain and use a thermometer,
however, when it is possible to do so:—</p>

<p class='c007'>When larger quantities are needed, it is only necessary
to multiply each of the combining quantities
by the same number. For instance, if a gallon
and a half of water is needed for a foot bath
at 106°, pour into a pail or bath-tub four quarts
of fresh well water and then add two quarts of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>boiling water. If four gallons of water are
wanted for a sitz bath at 93° (a very common
temperature), pour into the bath-tub three gallons
of fresh well or spring water, and add one gallon
of boiling water. Thus any required quantity can
be obtained at the temperatures given. The cold
water should be placed in the vessel first, and
there should be no delay in adding the hot water,
as it would rapidly lose its heat, and thus make
a larger quantity necessary. Determinate measurement
is not essential. The cold and hot water
may be added alternately in proper proportions,
being measured by the same vessel until the requisite
quantity is prepared.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>RULES FOR BATHING.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The following general rules should be carefully
studied and thoroughly understood by any one who
expects to employ the bath. Much injury to
health and most of the discredit cast upon the
use of water as a remedy have arisen from a
disregard of some of them:—</p>

<p class='c007'>1. A full bath should never be taken within
two or three hours after a meal.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Such local baths as fomentations, compresses,
foot baths, and even sitz baths, may be taken an
hour or two after a meal; indeed, compresses and
fomentations may be applied almost immediately
after a light meal, without injury.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. Employ the thermometer to determine the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>temperature of every bath when possible to do so;
if not, employ the other methods described.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. The temperature of the room during a bath
should be 70° to 85°. Invalids require a warmer
room than persons in health. Thorough ventilation
is an important matter; but draughts must
be carefully prevented, by screens of netting
placed before openings into the room when necessary.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. Never apply either very cold or excessively
hot treatment to aged or feeble patients. Cold is
especially dangerous.</p>

<p class='c007'>6. Hot baths are rarely useful in health. The
warm bath answers all the requirements of cleanliness.</p>

<p class='c007'>7. Never take a cold bath when exhausted or
chilly. A German emperor lost his life by taking
a cool bath after a fatiguing march. Alexander
came near losing his life in the same manner.
Many have been rendered cripples for life
by so doing. No harm will result from a cool
bath if the body is simply warm, even though it
may be in a state of perspiration. Contrary to the
common opinion, a considerable degree of heat is
the best possible preparation for a cold bath.
The Finlanders rush out of their hot ovens—sweat-houses—and
roll in the snow, without injury.</p>

<p class='c007'>8. Cold baths should not be administered during
the period of menstruation in females. At
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>such times, little bathing of any kind is advisable
with the exception of a warm or tepid sponge
bath, or such treatment as may be advised by a
physician.</p>

<p class='c007'>9. Bath attendants should carefully avoid giving
“shocks” to nervous people or to those inclined
to apoplexy or affected with heart disease.
Shocks are unpleasant and unnecessary for any
one.</p>

<p class='c007'>10. Never apply to the head such treatment as
will cause shock, as the sudden cold douche,
shower, or spray bath.</p>

<p class='c007'>11. A light hand bath every morning will be
none too frequent to preserve scrupulous bodily
cleanliness. More than a week should never be
allowed to elapse without a bath with warm
water and soap.</p>

<p class='c007'>12. The best time for treatment—especially
cool treatment—is about three hours after breakfast.</p>

<p class='c007'>13. Always employ for bathing purposes the
purest water attainable. Soft water is greatly
preferable to hard on many accounts.</p>

<p class='c007'>14. Those not strong and vigorous should avoid
drinking freely of cold water just previous to a
bath.</p>

<p class='c007'>15. The head should always be wet before any
bath; and the feet should be warmed—if not already
warm—by a hot foot bath, if necessary.</p>

<p class='c007'>16. In applying a bath to sick persons, it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>should always be made of a temperature agreeable
to the feelings.</p>

<p class='c007'>17. One very important element in the success
of a bath is the dexterity of the attendant. The
patient should be inspired with confidence both
in the bath and in the skill of the attendant. The
mind has much to do with the effect of a bath.</p>

<p class='c007'>18. In general baths, the patient, unless feeble,
will derive benefit by assisting himself as much
as possible.</p>

<p class='c007'>19. Patients should receive due attention during
a bath, so that they may not feel that they
are forgotten. Nervous patients often become very
apprehensive on this account. It is also important,
in most cases, that a reasonable degree of
quietude should be maintained.</p>

<p class='c007'>20. When any unusual or unexpected symptoms
appear during a bath, the patient should be
removed at once.</p>

<p class='c007'>21. In case symptoms of faintness appear, as is
sometimes the case in feeble patients, during a
hot bath, apply cold water to the head and face,
give cool water to drink, lower the temperature
of the bath by adding cool water, and place the
patient as nearly as possible in a horizontal position.</p>

<p class='c007'>22. The temperature of a warm or hot bath
should always be decreased just before its termination
as a precaution against taking cold.</p>

<p class='c007'>23. In health, a cool or cold bath should be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>very brief, lasting not more than one or two minutes.
A tepid bath should last not more than
ten or fifteen minutes. A warm bath may be continued
thirty or forty minutes, or even longer,
but nothing could be more absurd than the custom
prevailing in some places of prolonging the
bath to great length. At Pfeffers and Leuck, in
Switzerland, many persons spend the whole day
in the water, taking their meals on floating tables,
and occupying their time in reading, playing
chess, and other games. Some remain in the water
as many as sixteen hours out of the twenty-four.
Of course, certain baths may be advantageously
prolonged in cases of disease; but no
intelligent physician will now recommend the
antiquated practice which we sometimes see represented
by a patient seated in a tub, with an
open book in hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>24. It is of extreme importance that the patient
should be carefully dried after any bath.
A large sheet is much better for this purpose
than a towel. An old linen or cotton sheet is
preferable to a new one, being softer. Full directions
are given under the heading, “Dry Rubbing-Sheet.”</p>

<p class='c007'>25. A patient should never be left chilly after
a bath. Rub until warm.</p>

<p class='c007'>26. It is equally important that the body
should not be left in a state of perspiration, for it
will soon become chilly.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>27. Patients who are able to do so should exercise
a little both before and immediately after
a bath to insure thorough reaction.</p>

<p class='c007'>28. An hour’s rest soon after a bath will add
to its beneficial effects. It is best to go to bed
and cover warm.</p>

<p class='c007'>29. If a bath is followed by headache and fever,
there has been something wrong, either in
the kind of bath administered, or in the manner
of giving it.</p>

<p class='c007'>30. Very cold and very hot baths are seldom
required. The barbarous practices of half a century
ago are now obsolete, or should be, if they
are not quite discontinued as yet. No good resulted
from them which cannot be attained by
milder means, and much harm was occasioned
which is avoided by the use of less extreme temperatures.</p>

<p class='c007'>31. Patients should not be allowed to become
dependent on any special form of bath, as an after-dinner
fomentation to aid digestion, the abdominal
bandage, or any other appliance. Destroy
such a habit if it has been formed.</p>

<p class='c007'>32. Order, cleanliness, dispatch, and a delicate
sense of propriety are items which every bath attendant
should keep constantly in mind, and
which will often contribute in no small degree
to success in the use of this agent.</p>

<p class='c007'>33. Never employ a bath without a definite
and legitimate purpose in view. It is somewhat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>customary, in many institutions where water is
employed, to apply it in a routine way. Many
baths are prescribed for the sake of producing
variety, or pleasing the patient. A faithful and
scientific physician will carefully adapt his remedies
to the condition of his patient, and will observe
the results. It seems to be a prevalent error
that it makes little difference how water is
applied, provided the patient is only wet. Warm,
hot, tepid, temperate, cool, and cold baths are
used indiscriminately.</p>

<p class='c007'>So, also, the different modes of administering
baths of the same temperature are disregarded in
many cases. In general, each particular form of
bath is especially adapted to the treatment of special
conditions, and it is the best test of the proficiency
of a physician, in the use of water, to observe
whether he recognizes the distinctions between
the various kinds of baths, and is able to
adapt them to the appropriate conditions.</p>

<p class='c007'>34. Giving too much treatment is likely to be
the error into which the inexperienced will fall,
rather than the opposite extreme. Nature cannot
be forced to do more than she is capable of
doing; and as nature must do the healing, if a
cure is accomplished, remedies should be of a
helping rather than a crowding or forcing nature.
The vitality of patients may be expended uselessly
by treatment, for baths excite vital resistance,
as well as drugs, a fact which many overlook.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>The dangers of over-treatment are not so
great as some imagine, however, who take the
opposite extreme, and advocate <i>rest</i> as the great
cure-all. We have seen patients who seemed to
be quite monomaniacs on the subject of “rest
cure,” who needed a good thorough stirring up
with useful exercise more than any other kind of
treatment.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>GENERAL BATHS.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Baths applied to the whole surface of the body
are, as we have already seen, among the most
powerful means of affecting the human system
either in health or disease. Baths of a temperature
less than that of the body, 98°, unless of
very brief application, uniformly decrease the
bodily temperature. That the diminution of
temperature is not merely local, being confined
to the skin and superficial structures, is shown
by the fact that the thermometer indicates a decline
of temperature in the interior of the body
as well. The bath diminishes the production of
heat throughout the whole system, besides abstracting
large quantities by its contact with the
body, as previously explained. The diminution
of temperature continues for hours after the bath,
especially in cases in which it was excessively
high at the time of administration. Hot baths
have, in general, an opposite effect.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>
  <h3 class='c012'>SWIMMING.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Swimming is a general bath combined with
vigorous exercise, as nearly all baths should be.
It is one of the most healthful kinds of exercise,
if not continued too long, as it frequently is. The
temperature of the water is commonly between
70° and 80° F., which make it a temperate bath.
Its effects are not far different from other forms
of bath of the same temperature. We have not
space to devote to a description of the art, since
there are valuable treatises on the subject.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>PLUNGE BATH.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The hot baths of the ancient Greeks and Romans
were usually followed by a plunge up to
the neck in a large basin of water four or five
feet deep, and large enough to allow the exercise
of swimming. Many hydropathic establishments
employ the same bath after packs and sweating
baths. A bath of this kind is not always attainable
without great expense; and it possesses
no particular advantage over other methods of
cooling the surface after a warm bath. It is a
very severe form of bath when employed at a
low temperature. In the days of Priessnitz, it
was used at a temperature of 45° or 50°. More
harm than good would result from a continuous
employment of such treatment. The cool plunge
should be of but a very few minutes’ duration,
and the patient should rub himself vigorously during
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>the bath. In this, as in all other cool baths,
the first contact with the water produces chilliness
or shock. After two or three minutes, or
less, this will be followed by a partial reaction,
even while the patient is in the water, accompanied
by a feeling of comfortable warmth. This
will shortly be again succeeded by a second chill,
which is not so likely to be followed by prompt
reaction; hence, the patient should always take
care to leave the bath before the occurrence of
the second chill, if he would avoid unpleasant
after-effects.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>SPONGE BATH.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The sponge or hand bath is perhaps the simplest
and most useful mode of applying water to the
surface of the body; for it requires the use of no
appliances which every one does not possess, and
it can be employed by any one without elaborate
preparation, and under almost any circumstances.
A great quantity of water is not required; a few
quarts are a plenty, and a pint will answer admirably
in an emergency. A soft sponge, or a
linen or cotton cloth, and one or two soft towels,
or a sheet, are the other requisites. The hand
may be used in the absence of a cloth or a
sponge for applying the water.</p>

<p class='c007'>The temperature of the bath should not be
above 95°, and 90° is generally better. Most
people can habitually employ a temperature of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>75° or 80° without injury. The use of a much
lower temperature is not commonly advisable,
and is often productive of great injury.</p>

<p class='c007'>Begin the bath, as usual, by wetting the head,
saturating the hair well. Wash the face, then
the neck, chest, shoulders, arms, trunk, and back.
Rub vigorously until the skin is red, to prevent
chilling; for even when the temperature of the
room is nearly equal to that of the body, the
rapid evaporation of water from the surface will
lower the external temperature very rapidly unless
a vigorous circulation is maintained.</p>

<p class='c007'>After thoroughly bathing the upper portion of
the body, turn the attention to the lower portion,
continuing the rubbing of the upper parts at
brief intervals to prevent chilliness. As soon as
the bathing is concluded, envelop the body in a
sheet and rub dry, or dry the skin with a towel.
When the surface is nearly or quite dried, rub
the whole vigorously with the bare hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>The bath should not be prolonged more than
ten or fifteen minutes. Five minutes is sufficient
to secure all the benefits of the bath, and even
three minutes will suffice for a very good bath.</p>

<p class='c007'>Persons who chill easily will find it better to
bathe only a portion of the body before drying
it. Some will even find it necessary to retain a
portion of the clothing upon the lower part of
the body while bathing and drying the upper
part.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>Weakly patients may receive this bath with
very little disturbance, even in bed. Only a
small portion of the body should be uncovered
at a time, being bathed, dried, rubbed, and then
covered while another part is treated in a similar
manner.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sponge bath may be administered anywhere
without danger of soiling the finest carpet,
by using care to make the sponge or cloth nearly
dry before applying it to the body. A rug may
be spread upon the floor as an extra precaution.
When used for cleanliness—as it should be daily—a
little fine soap should be added two or three
times a week, to remove the oleaginous secretion
from the skin.</p>

<p class='c007'>This bath is applicable whenever there is an
abnormal degree of bodily heat, and in such cases
may be applied every half-hour without injury.
It is useful in cases of nervousness and sleeplessness,
and, in fact, whenever water is required in
any form, it may be used with advantage.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>RUBBING WET-SHEET.</h3>

<p class='c013'>This bath is administered in two ways; with
the sheet very wet, or dripping, and with it
wrung nearly dry. The first method is frequently
called the dripping-sheet bath. In giving it,
proceed as follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'>When necessary to prevent injury to the floor
or carpet, place upon the floor a large rug or oilcloth.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>In the center, place a large wash-tub, in
the absence of a more convenient vessel. While
the patient is making himself ready for the bath,
procure two large cotton sheets. Gather one end
of each into folds so that it can be easily and
quickly spread out; lay one upon a chair close at
hand, and place the other in the tub. At a distance
of three or four feet from the tub, place a
low stool. Now place in the tub—if a bath at
about 93° is desired, and this will be the most
usual temperature—half a pailful of fresh well or
spring water, and one-third as much boiling water.
If a thermometer is at hand it should, of
course, be used to test the temperature. After
the patient has wet his head, let him step into
the tub, facing the assistant, with his arms
straight and pressed closely to his sides. Now
draw up the wet sheet by its gathered end to its
full length; draw out one side quickly, place the
corner over one shoulder of the patient, and while
holding it in place with one hand, quickly draw
the remainder of the sheet around him with the
other, bringing it up well around the neck, and
folding the second corner under the top so as to
hold it in place. But a few seconds should be
occupied in applying the sheet. Then commence
rubbing the patient vigorously with both hands,
one upon each side, rubbing to and fro three or
four times in each place, passing over the whole
body very rapidly, and then repeating the same,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>to prevent chilling of any part. Coarse, robust,
and phlegmatic people may be rubbed with a
good deal of severity; but persons with delicate
skin and acute sensibilities require gentler manipulation.</p>

<p class='c007'>After three or four minutes of energetic rubbing,
pour over the chest and shoulders a pailful of
water four or five degrees cooler than that of the
bath, which should be in readiness for instant use.
Then rub two or three minutes longer. Now
quickly disengage the wet sheet, allowing it to
drop into the tub. While the patient is stepping
upon the stool, quickly grasp the dry sheet, and
by the time he is in place, have him enveloped
in it. Rub him dry, passing over the whole body
several times in rapid succession, to prevent chilling.
Care must be taken that every part is thoroughly
dried. The head, armpits, groins, and
feet are liable to escape attention. No moisture
should be left between the toes. After wiping
nearly or quite dry, apply the hand-rubbing, as
elsewhere described, using care not to induce
perspiration by too vigorous or long-continued
rubbing. If the skin should become moist from
perspiration after having been once dried, gradually
lower the temperature of the room and continue
light rubbing until the skin becomes dry
and cool before allowing the patient to dress.</p>

<p class='c007'>Very few baths afford a better opportunity
for the display of skill and energy on the part of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>the attendant than this. Some practice is required
to enable one to give it really well.</p>

<p class='c007'>The other form of rubbing wet-sheet is given
in about the same manner, the only difference
being that the sheet is wrung before its application,
and is re-applied one or more times, according
as a milder or more severe form of treatment
is required. The douche may be reserved until
the sheet is removed the last time.</p>

<p class='c007'>One precaution especially necessary to be observed
in this bath, as well as in all others where
a tepid application is succeeded by a cooler one,
is frequently overlooked. <i>The second cooler application
should never be made until there is
good reaction from the first.</i></p>

<p class='c007'>This is an excellent bath to apply after packs
or warm baths which have induced perspiration,
as hot-air and vapor baths. It is especially applicable
to cases in which there is defective circulation
in the extremities, torpid skin and liver,
and nervousness. It is of special benefit in cases
of debility accompanied by night sweats.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>WET-SHEET PACK.</h3>

<p class='c013'>When properly administered, this is one of the
most powerful of all water appliances. Some
skill is needed to apply it with a uniform degree
of success. Two or three comfortables or thick
blankets, one woolen blanket, and a large linen
or cotton sheet are the articles necessary. It is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>important to be certain that the sheet is sufficiently
large to extend twice around the patient’s
body. More blankets are required in cool weather
and by weak patients. Spread upon a bed or
straight lounge the comfortables, one by one,
making them even at the top. Over them, spread
the woolen blanket, allowing its upper edge to
fall an inch or two below that of the last comfortable.
Wet the sheet in water of the proper temperature,
having gathered the ends so that it can
be quickly spread out. Wring so that it will not
drip much, place its upper end even with the
woolen blanket, and spread it out on each side of
the middle sufficiently to allow the patient to lie
down upon his back, which he should quickly do,
letting his ears come just above the upper border
of the sheet, and extending his limbs near together.
The patient should then raise his arms,
while the attendant draws over one side of the
wet sheet, taking care to bring it in contact
with as much of the body as possible, bringing it
closely up beneath the arms, and pressing it down
between the limbs so as to make it come in contact
with both sides of them. Tuck the edge
tightly under the patient on the opposite side,
using care not to include the other edge of the
sheet. Now let the patient clasp his hands
across his chest, and then bring up the other side
of the sheet. Grasp it by its upper corner with
one hand, drawing it down over the shoulder and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>lengthwise of the body; then place the other
hand upon the covered shoulder, holding the
sheet firmly in place while the corner is carried
upward upon the opposite side and tucked under
the shoulder, thus drawing the upper edge of
the sheet well up under the chin. Tuck the edge
of the sheet under the body, carefully enveloping
the feet. Then bring over each side of the blanket
and comfortables in the manner last described,
being very careful to exclude all air at the neck,
and allowing the blankets to extend below the
feet so that they can be folded under.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not desirable that the patient should be
bound as tightly as a mummy. All that is necessary
is the exclusion of air, and as the neck
and feet are the points at which it is most likely
to enter, these parts should receive particular attention,
as directed. If too tightly bound, the
patient will be more likely to be nervous than if
allowed some freedom. The application of the
wet sheet should be made in a few seconds, as it
cools very rapidly when spread out. The first
blanket should be brought over the patient as
soon as possible. If the feet are not warm, a hot
foot bath should be taken before the pack. If
they become cool in the pack, hot jugs, bricks, or
stones should be applied to them. If the patient
does not become comfortably warm in a few minutes—ten
or fifteen at most—more blankets
should be added, and, if necessary, dry heat should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>be applied to the sides. If he still remains chilly,
he should be promptly removed and placed
in a warm bath, or vigorously rubbed with a dry
sheet and then placed in a dry pack. The head
should be kept cool by frequent wetting while
the patient is in the bath. If a compress is applied,
it should be often renewed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The temperature of the pack must depend upon
the condition of the patient, being determined by
principles elsewhere explained. A woolen sheet
is better for the administration of a hot pack
than one of cotton or linen. The cold pack is
very rarely required. The usual temperature
for this bath should be about 92°. It is proper
to wet the sheet in water of about 100°, as it
will be cooled several degrees while being applied.</p>

<p class='c007'>The duration of the pack should be carefully
regulated by the condition of the patient, the effects
desired, and the immediate effects produced.
If the patient becomes very nervous, or sweats
excessively, or becomes faint, or has other seriously
unpleasant or dangerous symptoms, he should
be removed from the pack at once if he has not
been more than ten minutes in it. Ordinarily,
the pack may continue thirty to forty-five minutes.
If the patient sleeps naturally, he may
remain in the pack a full hour if strong, or even
longer in many cases. In fevers, short packs,
frequently repeated, are more beneficial than long
ones fewer in number.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>The pack should be followed by the spray, the
sponge bath, the douche, or the rubbing wet-sheet.
It is a powerful remedy, and should not be used
to excess in chronic diseases; it has been much
abused in this way. Its depurating effects are
really wonderful. The increased action of the
skin, together with determination of blood to
that part, is so great that poisons long hidden in
the system are brought out and eliminated. The
odor of a sheet recently used in packing a gross
person is often intolerable. If the patient be a
tobacco user, the sheet will be reeking with the
odor of nicotine. Many times, the sheet will be
actually discolored with the impurities withdrawn
from the body.</p>

<p class='c007'>The applications of the pack in treating disease
are very numerous. In almost all acute diseases
accompanied by general febrile disturbance,
and in nearly all chronic diseases, it is a most
helpful remedy if rightly managed. It is an admirable
remedy for nervousness, skin diseases,
and irritations of the mucous membrane. The
warm pack is a remedy worth more in the treatment
of children’s diseases than all the drugs in
the materia medica, as many physicians have
proved. It is a most successful application in
convulsions.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>SHOWER PACK.</h3>

<p class='c013'>In many cases of fever in which the temperature
rises so high as to produce delirium, the ordinary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>pack does not seem to be sufficiently
powerful to fully control the excessive heat. In
such cases, the shower pack is found of great service;
it is thus used in Bellevue Hospital, New
York:—</p>

<p class='c007'>A rubber blanket is placed upon an ordinary
mattress. Upon this, the patient is placed, enveloped
in a wet sheet, as in the ordinary pack. Instead
of being covered with blankets, however,
he is left exposed to the air, so that the powerful
cooling effects of evaporation may be obtained.
As the sheet becomes warmed by the heat of the
body, cool water is showered upon it from a
sprinkler or watering-pot. The bath is continued
thus until the temperature of the patient, as
indicated by the thermometer, is sufficiently diminished.</p>

<p class='c007'>This bath, combining as it does the cooling effects
of cool water and of evaporation, is the most
powerful refrigerant that can be employed; yet
it is perfectly safe when judiciously used, being
only applied in cases of extreme urgency on account
of the high temperature.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some practice opening the ordinary pack at
intervals, and sprinkling cool water upon the patient,
thus obtaining, in some degree, the prolonged
cooling effect. The pack must be studied
well to enable one to apply it with skill, and certainty
of success.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>
  <h3 class='c012'>DRY SHEET PACK.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Though this can hardly be called a bath at
its commencement, it really becomes a wet-sheet
pack before its termination. Its application differs
from that of the wet-sheet pack in that the
patient is wrapped in woolen blankets instead of
the wet sheet. The object of this treatment is
to produce perspiration, which may be encouraged
by drinking either cold or hot drinks in considerable
quantity, and by the application of dry
artificial heat to the feet and sides. It is a very
severe form of treatment, and is now seldom
practiced. Many years ago, patients at hydropathic
establishments were often kept for several
hours in the dry pack, smothered beneath loads
of comfortables, blankets, and feather-beds. If
cautiously employed, it is occasionally useful in
“breaking the chills,” in fever and ague. It
should be administered about half an hour before
the time for the beginning of the chill, if required
for this purpose.</p>

<p class='c007'>The several varieties of local packs are described
under the head of Local Baths.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>FULL BATH.</h3>

<p class='c013'>For this bath a tub is required the length of
the body, about eighteen inches deep, two feet
wide at the top, and, preferably, six inches narrower
at the bottom. It is better to have the
end intended for the head a little elevated.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>Place in the tub sufficient water so that the patient
will be entirely covered, with the exception
of the head, when he lies upon his back. During
the bath, the body should be vigorously
rubbed by the bather or an attendant, or both,
particular pains being taken to knead and manipulate
the abdomen, in a gentle, but thorough
manner. The temperature of the bath, when
taken for cleanliness, or for its soothing effects,
should be not more than 95°, and it should be
cooled down to about 85° before the conclusion
of the bath, by the addition of cool water.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every family ought to possess conveniences
for this bath. Indeed, it is now found in every
well-regulated modern house in our large cities.
It is not so expensive but that any one can possess
it. Portable baths of rubber can be obtained
which are worth many times their cost. A cheap
bath can be constructed of duck well oiled or
covered with paint and suspended from a frame;
but it will be quite unsatisfactory, not being perfectly
water-tight, as such a bath should be for
family use. A stationary bath may be made of
wood, of the dimensions given, and lined with
lead or zinc. There should be an opening in the
lower end for withdrawing the water.</p>

<p class='c007'>The full bath is one of the most refreshing of
all baths, being also one of the most pleasant.
Employed at a low temperature, it is a powerful
means of reducing excessive heat in fevers. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>hot full bath very promptly relieves the pains of
acute rheumatism, and is almost a specific for
colds, if taken just before retiring. Very hot and
very cold temperatures are quite hazardous with
this bath, since it involves so large a portion of
the body. Such extremes are rarely useful in
any case, and should not be used except under
the eye of a physician.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>HALF BATH.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The half bath is much the same as the full
bath. A smaller tub is required, as the bather
sits upright with his limbs extended. The water
should be at least a foot deep. During the bath,
the body should be well rubbed, and water should
be poured over the upper portion of the body.
Its general effects are nearly the same as those of
the full bath, and it may be used for the same
general purposes. A little more vigorous rubbing
is required to prevent chilling, as so large a portion
of the body is exposed. It affords a better
opportunity for stirring up the bowels and abdominal
viscera by shaking, percussing, and
kneading the abdomen.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>SHALLOW BATH.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Of this bath there are two varieties; <i>sitting
shallow</i> and <i>standing shallow</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Sitting shallow</i> differs from the half bath in
employing less water, and being much more vigorous.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>Its effects and uses are about the same.
The bather should rub his limbs and the front
portion of his body while the attendant pours
water over his chest and shoulders, and rubs vigorously
his back and sides. A person can take
the bath very well alone by using a rather long
coarse towel which can be drawn back and forth
across the back by grasping one end with each
hand. It is a very valuable means of applying
water, and is in constant requisition in the hydropathic
establishments. From 85° to 90° is the
proper temperature for this bath. It may be
used at a lower temperature in fever cases. At
Bellevue Hospital it is applied at about 70° in
such cases, and is administered whenever the
temperature exceeds 103°. To avoid the shock of
a cool bath, it may be commenced at a temperature
little below blood-heat and then gradually
cooled by the addition of cool water until the desired
temperature is reached. The reduction of
the temperature obtained by this means fully
equals that obtained by the sudden application of
cold, and the shock and subsequent reaction are
prevented. This applies equally to all cool baths
as well as the cool shallow bath.</p>

<p class='c007'>The duration of the bath may be from one to
thirty minutes. Ten or fifteen minutes will be
the usual extent.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>Standing Shallow</i> is in some cases preferred
by some to the preceding. The patient stands
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>erect in a varying depth of water—from six inches
to one or two feet being employed—while
his body is vigorously rubbed by one or two assistants,
water being poured upon the chest and
shoulders at brief intervals. It is a very enlivening
bath.</p>

<p class='c007'>The shallow bath should be completed by a
pail douche at a temperature three or four degrees
lower than that of the bath.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>AFFUSION.</h3>

<p class='c013'>This consists simply in pouring water over the
body of the patient, who may be sitting or standing
in a bath-tub. It is a very efficient bath for
reducing unnatural heat. This mode of treatment
was used by Hippocrates, Galen, and other
ancient physicians. In the last century, Currie,
Jackson, and many others used it with great success
in scarlatina. It is a sovereign remedy for
delirium tremens, sun-stroke, hysteria, and sometimes
of acute mania, when applied of the proper
temperature.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>PAIL DOUCHE.</h3>

<p class='c013'>This bath scarcely differs from the preceding.
It consists in the dashing of one or more pailfuls
of water upon the body of the bather by an assistant.
By means of a proper arrangement, the
bather can administer the bath himself. For this
purpose, a pail or other vessel filled with water
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>may be suspended or supported above the head of
the bather in such a way that it can be quickly
upset by drawing upon a string attached to the
side. The stream should fall upon the shoulders,
chest, back, or hips, but not upon the head or over
the region of the stomach. This bath may be
applied after any warm bath, and should be a little
cooler than the bath which precedes it.
Whether taken alone or after another bath, it
should always be followed by vigorous rubbing.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>CATARACT DOUCHE.</h3>

<p class='c013'>This is a modification of the douche bath in
which a broad sheet of water is allowed to fall
upon the body of the bather. The force of the
bath depends upon the height from which the
water falls, and should be regulated according to
the strength of the patient. Almost any one will
bear a fall of three or four feet. When the height
of the bath cannot be easily modified, it should
be of such an altitude as to be well borne by the
feeblest patients; the more vigorous can increase
its effects by subjecting themselves to it for a
longer time.</p>

<p class='c007'>The observations made relating to the application
of the pail douche, apply equally well to
this bath.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>
  <h3 class='c012'>HOSE DOUCHE.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>In this bath, water under pressure is thrown
upon the patient from a hose, through a small
nozzle. The bather turns his body while the attendant
directs the stream upon different parts.
It is a less pleasant bath than the spray or other
forms of douche. Its general effects are the same
as those of the baths mentioned.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>SHOWER BATH.</h3>

<p class='c013'>This bath is simply an imitation of rain. Water
is allowed to fall upon the body after being divided
into a number of small streams by passing
through a vessel with a perforated bottom. Its
effects depend upon the size of the streams and
the height from which they fall, together with the
temperature of the bath and its duration. Although
formerly much employed in water cure
establishments, this bath is now little used, because
its place is supplied by other more convenient
ones which produce the same results, as the
spray and douche. The best manner of administering
it is to commence the application with
tepid water, and gradually cool it. The temperature
may range from 70° to 92°. The water
should not usually be allowed to fall upon the
head, but should be received first upon the hands
and arms, then upon the feet and limbs, and afterward
upon the back and shoulders, the body
being well rubbed during the application.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>The cold shower bath, formerly so common almost
everywhere, has been productive of much
injury by its indiscriminate use, and has brought
much reproach upon the use of water as a curative
agent. None but the most vigorous can enjoy
the bath at a lower temperature than 70°, and
no advantage is gained by its employment at a
lower temperature than that, while considerable
harm may be done in many cases.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>SPRAY BATH.</h3>

<p class='c013'>This bath consists in a number of fine streams
of water thrown upon the bather, with considerable
force. It may be produced by connecting a
hose with spray attachment to a force-pump or
reservoir from which to obtain water under a sufficient
pressure. The best form of attachment
consists of a hollow double-convex brass or copper
piece, one side of which is perforated with fine
holes, the other side carrying a rim for attachment
to the hose. It is preferable to have an arrangement
by which the temperature may be
readily and gradually changed from warm or tepid
to cool without interrupting the bath. In the absence
of a proper spray attachment, the apparatus
elsewhere described for the hose douche may
be made to answer a very good purpose, the
stream being broken by placing the thumb or
finger over the nozzle in such a way as to partially
obstruct the flow.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>This is an excellent bath to follow the pack,
vapor bath, hot-air bath, sitz bath, or any other
general bath which induces perspiration. It is
very agreeable to most persons, and can be applied
to feeble patients who would be unable to take
any more severe form of treatment. The alternate
hot and cold spray is very successful as a
means of reducing local inflammations. The warm
bath is very grateful and soothing to swollen and
rheumatic joints; in gout, also, and illy defined,
wandering pains, it is an admirable remedy. It
is very successful, also, in the treatment of tumors,
abscesses, and chronic ulcers, when thoroughly
applied.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>LOCAL BATHS.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The use of water as a local application is not
less important, and is much more varied, than its
general application. There is no other topical
remedy which will produce such a variety of effects
and such prompt results. In removing local
congestions, subduing local inflammations, allaying
circumscribed pain, and restoring activity to
inactive parts, the appropriate applications of
water give results which afford both physician
and patient a degree of satisfaction which no
other single remedy can rival, even electricity, an
agent of acknowledged power, not being excepted.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>
  <h3 class='c012'>SITZ BATH.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The sitz bath, also known as the hip bath, is
one of the most useful baths employed in hydropathic
treatment. Its utility was fully recognized
by the earlier practitioners, who sometimes kept
their patients so long in the bath that they became
almost literally water-soaked, and were so
numb from the long-continued application of cold
water as to possess almost no external sensibility.
It is said that in some cases the skin could be
rubbed off in the attempts to obtain reaction,
without the patient’s knowledge.</p>

<p class='c007'>For this bath a common tub may be used, by
placing a support under one edge to elevate it
two or three inches; but it is better to use a tub
made for the purpose, which should have the
back raised eight or ten inches higher than the
front, to support the back, the sides sloping gradually
so as to support the arms of the bather.
The bottom should be elevated two or three
inches. The depth in front should be about the
same as that of a common wash-tub.</p>

<p class='c007'>Enough water is required to cover the hips and
extend a little way up the abdomen; four to six
gallons will suffice. Any temperature may be
employed, being suited to the condition of the
patient. The duration of the bath will also vary
according to circumstances. A short cool bath is
tonic in its effects, like all short cool applications;
a more prolonged one is a powerful sedative.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>The hot sitz is very exciting in its effects if long
continued. The warm bath is relaxing. The
hips and trunk should be well rubbed during the
bath by the patient or an attendant. The bather
should be covered with a sheet or blanket during
the bath. If it is desirable to produce sweating,
several blankets may be used.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sitz bath should seldom be taken either
very hot or extremely cold. A very good plan
for administering it, and one which will be applicable
to most cases, is this: Begin the bath at
92° or 93°. If a thermometer is not at hand,
pour into the bath-tub three gallons of fresh well
or spring water, and then add one gallon of <i>boiling</i>
water. This will give the desired temperature.
After the patient has been in the bath ten
minutes, cool it down to 85°, which may be done
by adding a gallon of well water. Continue the
bath five minutes longer, then administer a pail
douche or spray, at about 85°, and wipe dry, as
directed after a rubbing wet-sheet.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sitz bath is useful for chronic congestions
of the abdominal and pelvic viscera, diarrhea,
piles, dysentery, constipation, uterine diseases,
and genital and urinary disorders. In treating
female diseases it is an indispensable remedy. It
is very valuable in various nervous affections, especially
those which immediately involve the
brain.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is no better remedy for a cold than a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>very warm sitz bath taken while fasting, and
just before retiring. It should be continued until
gentle perspiration is induced.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sitz may be converted into a general bath
by rubbing the whole body with the wet hand
while in the bath, and may thus be made to answer
the purposes of the half and shallow baths.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>LEG BATH.</h3>

<p class='c013'>For this bath a vessel deep enough to receive
the limbs to the middle of the thighs is required.
The bath may be taken at any desired temperature;
but it is usually employed somewhat cooler
than baths which involve the trunk of the body.
It is a powerfully derivative bath, and is found
very useful to prevent wakefulness in nervous
persons, and to relieve cerebral congestion in epileptic
patients. It is especially applicable to
chronic ulcers of the leg, swollen knees and ankles,
and limbs which have suffered by exposure
to severe cold. It gives much relief in gout;
there is no danger of causing a metastasis of the
disease by the application of this bath.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>FOOT BATH.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Any vessel sufficiently large to receive the feet,
and enough water to cover them to the ankles, is
suitable for this bath. The feet should be rubbed
during the bath. If the temperature is cool,
only an inch or two of water should be employed.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>The <i>walking foot bath</i> is an excellent remedy
for cold feet. It consists in walking in shallow
water five or ten minutes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The alternate hot and cold <i>foot bath</i> is another
valuable remedy for cold feet, and is a certain
remedy for chilblains. It is given thus: Place
the feet in hot water—100° to 110°—three or
four minutes. Then withdraw them and plunge
them quickly into a bath of cold water—60° or
less. After two or three minutes, restore them
to the hot bath. Thus alternate three or four
times, and conclude by dipping the feet quickly
into cold water and wiping dry. This bath produces
most powerful reaction.</p>

<p class='c007'>The foot bath is applicable in the treatment of
headache, neuralgia, toothache, catarrh, congestion
of abdominal and pelvic organs, colds, and
cold feet. It is very useful as a preparatory for
other baths, and as an accompaniment of other
local applications.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>HALF PACK.</h3>

<p class='c013'>This bath is given in the same manner as the
wet-sheet pack, except that the wet sheet extends
only from the armpits to the hips. The blankets
are wrapped about the patient in the manner
described for the full pack. All the precautions
given in connection with the description of that
bath are applicable to this.</p>

<p class='c007'>This bath is frequently employed in cases of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>patients who are too feeble to bear the full pack,
or as a preparatory treatment for that bath. It
is much milder than the full pack, and is usually
more agreeable to the patient, as it does not confine
him so closely. It is a very useful remedy
in all inflammations of the abdominal organs, gastralgia,
pleurisy, acute bronchitis, croup, and pneumonia.
When a hot application is required, it is
well to use a woolen sheet instead of a cotton
one. It requires the same after-treatment as the
full pack.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>CHEST PACK.</h3>

<p class='c013'>This application is made in the same manner
as the half pack, allowing the wet sheet to extend
only from the armpits to the navel. It is
especially applicable to diseases of the chest.
The general directions for the full and the half
pack apply to it. It is a very mild application.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>LEG PACK.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The pack may be applied to the legs with
great advantage in cases of habitual coldness of
the feet and limbs or knees. The same principles
mentioned in relation to other packs apply to
this. The application should be made either
cool or cold, and should extend from the hips
downward. It should continue from half an hour
to an hour and a half.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>
  <h3 class='c012'>CHEST WRAPPER.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>This consists of a jacket made something like
a vest, reaching from the neck to a little below
the navel. It should be made of double thicknesses
of soft toweling. To protect the garments or bedding
from moisture, it should be covered with another
jacket made like it but a little larger. In
applying it, the wrapper should be wet in tepid
water, and should then be applied as snugly as
consistent with the comfort of the wearer. It
should be re-applied every two or three hours, as
it becomes dry.</p>

<p class='c007'>If properly managed, the chest wrapper is a
valuable remedy; but it has been greatly abused.
It should not be worn more than a week without
intermission. The practice of some in continuing
it until it produces an eruption of the skin,
and even longer—to promote a discharge—under
the idea that a vicarious elimination is thus performed,
is highly reprehensible, and has no sound
physiological principle to support it. Such treatment
is damaging to the skin, and does the patient
no good in any way. The better plan is to
allow the wrapper to be worn during the night,
but omitted during the daytime. If worn during
the day, it should be changed often, and should
be removed so soon as the patient becomes chilly.
Whenever removed, the surface of the skin should
be washed or sponged with cool or tepid water.
Feeble patients with defective circulation should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>wear the wrapper only while walking or riding
on horseback.</p>

<p class='c007'>This appliance may be profitably employed in
a large number of chronic diseases. In chronic
bronchitis, pleurisy, pleurodynia, asthma, and
the early stages of consumption, it gives relief.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>WET GIRDLE.</h3>

<p class='c013'>This was a favorite remedy with the early
German hydropathists, and it is a very useful appliance
when properly employed, though it has
been much abused by excessive use, as in the
case of the chest wrapper. To apply it well, a
coarse towel about three yards long is the most
convenient for use. Wet one-half of this, in tepid
water, wring it until it will not drip, and apply
it to the abdomen, placing one end at the side,
and bringing it across the front first, so that two
thicknesses of the wet portion will cover the abdomen.
After winding the whole tightly around the
body, fasten the end securely. The remarks made
in reference to the wearing of the chest wrapper
apply with equal force to the wet girdle. For
feeble patients it is better to wet only that portion
of the towel which covers the abdomen.</p>

<p class='c007'>This a very efficient remedy for constipation,
chronic diarrhea, and most other intestinal disorders.
It is equally valuable in dyspepsia, torpid
liver, enlarged spleen, and uterine derangements.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>
  <h3 class='c012'>ASCENDING DOUCHE.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>This modification of the douche is simply an
ascending instead of a descending stream. It
can be readily managed by constructing a reservoir
in such position as to give the water ten or
twelve feet fall, when the requisite force cannot
be more easily secured. The water is conducted
through a hose, and is allowed to issue through
a nozzle near the floor. The patient sits or lies
just over the nozzle, and a few inches above it.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is a valuable remedy in treating piles, prolapsus
of the bowels or uterus, and constipation.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>DROP BATH.</h3>

<p class='c013'>In applying this bath, a vessel with a small
opening in the bottom is elevated to a considerable
height, water placed in it being allowed to
drop upon the part to be treated. The aperture
in the vessel should be only sufficiently large to
give egress to a single drop at a time. The bath
may also be given by placing in an elevated vessel
one end of a skein of cotton yarn, the other
being allowed to fall over the edge of the vessel
and hang below it. By capillary attraction the
water will be drawn up into the yarn and will
drop off at the lower end very slowly.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is a very convenient way of applying
water where its cooling effects are required for a
considerable length of time, as in wounds, bruises,
sprains, and similar cases. It will “keep down
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>inflammation” in a wonderful manner. It is not
commonly necessary that the water should be
very cold, as evaporation will keep the part sufficiently
cool in most cases.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>ARM BATH.</h3>

<p class='c013'>This is simply holding the arm in water of
proper temperature. It is extremely useful in
such painful affections as felons, sprains, and
nearly all injuries of the hand and arm. Ulcers
and acute and chronic skin diseases of the hands
and arm are usually benefited by this bath. If
cold water is painful, its application should be
preceded by that of hot water, or alternated with
it. Cold hands should be frequently rubbed in
cool water, and alternately immersed for a few
minutes each in hot and cold water. In case of
painful felons, the arm must be immersed to the
elbow to relieve the pain, although the disease
is only in the finger.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>HEAD BATH.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The patient should lie upon his back, resting
his head in a shallow basin of cool water. The
attendant should bathe the forehead, face, and
temples during the bath. The bath may be continued
until the heat is removed or lessened.</p>

<p class='c007'>The pouring head bath is often preferable to
the preceding. The patient should lie upon a
bed or sofa, face downward, allowing his head
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>to extend outward over a tub or other wide vessel,
while the water is poured upon the head
from a little height, by an assistant. The water
may be either hot or cold, according to existing
conditions. Very cold water is not usually advisable,
as its application soon becomes painful,
and produces powerful reaction. It should be
tepid or temperate. Some cases require very hot
water for a few minutes, followed by a slight affusion
of tepid water.</p>

<p class='c007'>In hysteria, epilepsy, apoplexy, sun-stroke,
acute mania, delirium tremens, and cerebral congestion
from any cause, the head bath is a
promptly efficacious remedy.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>EYE BATH.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Water may be applied to the eye in various
ways. A convenient method when only a brief
application is necessary, is to lave the eye with
water dipped by the hand. A gentle spray may
be applied, or the eyes may be opened and closed
in water, thus bringing them freely in contact
with the element. Small glass cups made for
the purpose may be filled with water and placed
over the eye, the water being frequently changed;
or wet cloths may be laid upon them.</p>

<p class='c007'>In applying water to the eye, it is important
to be able to first distinguish the exact nature of
the difficulty, as much damage may otherwise be
done by a wrong application. As a general rule,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>inflammations of the conjunctiva and <i>external</i>
structures of the eye require <i>cool</i> or <i>cold</i> applications,
while inflammations of the cornea, iris, and
other <i>internal</i> structures, require <i>hot</i> applications.
This rule is often violated in hydropathic establishments
through ignorance of the structure and
diseases of the eye.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cool applications are best made by laying upon
the eyes thin folds of linen cloth wet in cold
water. Not more than two or three thicknesses
should be used, as a thick compress soon becomes
warm, while a thin one is kept cool for a longer
time by evaporation. The compress should be
changed every five minutes, at least, when there
is much inflammation. The fomentation is as
good as any method of applying hot water to the
eyes. The application, when hot, should be as
hot as the patient can well bear. If it affords
relief, continue half an hour or more; if it increases
the pain, desist at once. The same may
be said of cold applications also.</p>

<p class='c007'>Alternate hot and cold applications will give
most relief in some cases. After a hot application,
a slightly cooler one should always be applied
for a few minutes.</p>

<p class='c007'>A little milk, quince-seed mucilage, or other
bland substance, added to the water, makes it
more agreeable to the eye in bathing it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The eye bath is applicable in all inflammations
and injuries of the eye, and is infinitely superior
to all other eye washes.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>Daily bathing the eyes in tepid water is a good
practice for those who use them much in reading,
writing, or other work requiring close attention.
Many eyes are ruined by neglect and maltreatment.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>EAR BATH.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Water applications are made to the ear by
means of fomentations, compresses, the douche,
or the spray. Compresses and fomentations are
useful in inflammations of the structures of the
ear, including abscesses which often form in the
walls of the external canal. Alternate hot and
cold applications are useful in causing the absorption
of inflammatory deposits, and thus restoring
the hearing. The douche, administered with
the fountain syringe, is a valuable means of removing
foreign bodies and insects. The warm
douche has proved very serviceable in restoring
the hearing by removing hardened ear-wax. In
administering the douche, the head should be inclined
over a basin, while the stream of water is
allowed to issue from the nozzle held close to the
external opening of the ear. Violent syringing
of the ear should never be practiced, as it may
occasion irreparable injury.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>NOSE BATH.</h3>

<p class='c013'>This bath is administered either by drawing
water into the nose while the mouth is closed, or
by injecting it by means of a fountain syringe.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>Great care should always be exercised to apply
the water gently, as a forcible application will
cause pain and irritation. Injection should never
be practiced with a piston syringe, as there is liability
of forcing the water into the Eustachian
canals and producing deafness. The temperature
of the water should be warm or tepid for
most applications.</p>

<p class='c007'>Much benefit may be derived by the proper
use of this bath in case of acute or chronic catarrh.
The addition of a slight portion of salt to
the water does no harm, and a slightly saline
fluid is sometimes less unpleasant than pure water,
probably because it is more nearly like the
mucous secretion of the nasal mucous membrane.
Drawing cold water into the nose is sometimes
recommended for hemorrhage from the nose; but
it is of doubtful utility, because the application
cannot be continuous, and transient applications
of cold water are always followed by an afflux of
blood to the part so exposed. There are better
remedies for nose-bleed.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>COMPRESSES.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The compress is a wet cloth or bandage applied
to a part. The object may be to cool the part
under treatment, or to retain heat. The compress
may be used with equal success for either
purpose. When the part is to be cooled, a compress
composed of several folds should be wet in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>cool, cold, or iced water, as required, and placed
upon the part after being wrung so it will not
drip. It should be changed as often as <i>every five
minutes</i>. This is often neglected to the injury
of the patient. A very cold compress may be
prepared by placing snow or pounded ice between
the folds of the compress. This will not need
renewal so frequently; but its effects must be
carefully watched, as injury may be done by neglect.
In applying cold to such delicate parts as
the eye, a very thin compress is better. It should
be renewed once in five minutes, at least.</p>

<p class='c007'>When accumulated warmth is required, a thick
compress is applied, being wrung out of tepid
water, and covered with a dry cloth to exclude
the air. Soft, dry flannel is an excellent covering.
Rubber or oiled silk may be employed
when the compress is not to be retained more
than a few hours; but if it is to be worn continuously,
they will be injurious, as they are impervious
to air and thus interfere with the function
of the skin. The effects of a compress thus
applied are identical with those of the poultice,
and the application is a much more cleanly one.</p>

<p class='c007'>Compresses are applicable in all cases in which
poultices are commonly used. They may replace
the old-fashioned plasters with profit and comfort
to the wearer. The wet-sheet pack, half pack
chest pack and wrapper, leg pack, and wet girdle
are all large compresses.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>When applied continuously in the same place
for a long time, the compress occasions a considerable
eruption of the skin, and sometimes boils
and carbuncles. There is no particular advantage
in these eruptions, and they sometimes do much
harm by producing a great degree of general irritation.
The notion that they purify the system,
though a very popular one, has really a very
slight foundation. The discharge is largely made
up of elements which would be of great utility
if retained in the system, and the amount of
foul matter eliminated in this way is certainly
infinitesimal compared with the amount thrown
off by a few inches of healthy skin. The skin
can always do more and better work when
healthy than when diseased. The eruptions are
no doubt due to debility of the skin, produced
by a too long continuance of the very abnormal
conditions supplied by the compress. Yet, strange
as it may appear, there are those claiming to be
physicians who directly aim to produce inflamed
and irritated surfaces by the continuation of the
compress for months and even years.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>wet head cap</i> is a compress made to fit the
head. It should consist of several thicknesses of
cotton or linen cloth, so as to retain moisture for
some time. It is a good temporary appliance in
diseases of the scalp, and for headache; but it
should never be worn continuously for the purpose
of relieving congestion, as it will have an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>effect just the opposite of that desired. In eczema
of the scalp it may be worn until the disease
is cured, being frequently rewetted. It is an excellent
means of preventing sun-stroke and other
effects of heat when worn beneath the hat in
summer; but even for this purpose its use should
be temporary, the cap being worn only during
the hotter portion of the day.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>FOMENTATIONS.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The fomentation is a local application analogous
to such general appliances as the hot pack,
vapor bath, and hot-air bath. It consists in the
application of a cloth wet in hot water. It may
be considered as a hot compress. Fold a soft
<i>flannel</i> cloth twice, so that it will be of three or
four thicknesses. Lay it in a basin, pour boiling
water upon it, and wring it dry by folding it in
a dry towel. Or, if only one end of the cloth is
wet, it may be wrung by folding the dry portion
outside of the wet; in wringing, the whole will
become equally wet. Apply it to the patient as
hot as it can be borne. The second application
can usually be made much hotter than the first.
Frequently dipping the hands in cold water will
enable the attendant to wring the cloth much
hotter than he would otherwise be able to do.
The most convenient way is to heat the cloths in
a steamer; by this means they are made as hot
as boiling water, and yet they are more easily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>handled, not being saturated with water. When
no hot water is at hand, a fomentation may, in an
emergency, be quickly prepared by wetting the
flannel in cool water, wringing it as dry as desired,
folding it between the leaves of a newspaper,
and laying it upon the top of the stove, or
holding it smoothly against the side. The paper
prevents the cloth from becoming soiled, the water
protects the paper from burning, and the
steam generated quickly heats the cloth to boiling
heat. For a long fomentation, the heat may
be made continuous by applying over the wet
cloth a hot brick or slab of soapstone.</p>

<p class='c007'>The hot cloths should be re-applied once in five
minutes. Two cloths should be employed, so
that the second may be applied the moment the
first is removed. To retain the heat, a dry flannel,
rubber, or oilcloth should be placed over the
fomentation. The application may be continued
from ten minutes to half an hour, or longer in
special cases. This appliance is very powerful,
and should not be employed to excess. Alternate
hot and cold fomentations are frequently more
efficient than the continuous fomentation. Hot
applications should always be followed by a cool
or tepid compress for four or five minutes, at least.</p>

<p class='c007'>The uses of the fomentation are very numerous.
It is indicated whenever there is local pain
without excessive heat, or evidences of acute inflammation.
Local congestions, neuralgia, toothache,
pleurisy, pleurodynia, and most local pains
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>vanish beneath its potent influence as if by magic.
For indigestion, colic, constipation, torpid liver,
dysmenorrhea, and rheumatic pains, it is a remedy
of great power, and is used with almost uniform
success. In relieving sick headache by application
to the head, neck, and stomach, its efficiency
is unrivaled.</p>

<p class='c007'>When applied to the head for some time without
intermission, it will often occasion faintness;
hence, a cooler application should be made after
the use of the hot cloths for fifteen or twenty
minutes.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the applications must be continued for a long
time, it is well in most cases to apply them at a
temperature slightly lower than when they are
to be used for only a few minutes.</p>

<p class='c007'>This remedy may well replace the blisters,
plasters, cataplasms, scarifications, rubefacients,
and other irritating measures so long used for relieving
pain, local congestions, and inflammations.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>REFRIGERANT APPLICATIONS.</h3>

<p class='c013'>A freezing mixture which will reduce the temperature
to 4° is made by mixing equal parts of
salt and pounded ice. The ice and salt should be
stirred together very quickly and applied at once
to the part to be frozen. Two parts of dry snow
and one of salt make an equally good mixture.
Freezing is more conveniently performed by the
rapid evaporation of ether or rhigoline.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>Freezing is a useful process in numerous cases.
By its use, excrescences—as warts, wens, and polypi—fibrous
tumors, and even malignant tumors, as
cancer, may be successfully removed. Small cancers
may sometimes be cured by repeated and
long-continued freezing. Their growth may certainly
be impeded by this means. Felons, if
treated early in their course, may be cured by two
or three freezings.</p>

<p class='c007'>For freezing a felon, place the finger in a mixture
ice and salt, or surround it with cotton,
saturate the cotton with ether or rhigoline, and
blow it very strongly with a pair of bellows.
This is a very good method when an apparatus
for producing a fine spray is not at hand. The
latter instrument facilitates the freezing very
much if used with the bellows.</p>

<p class='c007'>No harm results from repeated freezing if proper
care is used in thawing the frozen parts.
They should be kept immersed in cool water, or
covered with cloths kept cool by frequent wetting
with cold water, until the natural feeling is restored.</p>

<p class='c007'>The application of ice is found extremely serviceable
in many inflammatory diseases, and in
some nervous affections. In inflammation of the
brain, the ice cap is of inestimable value. Ice applied
to the spine will check the convulsive spasms
of chorea and hysteria when other remedies fail.
In putrid sore throat, or malignant diphtheria,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>ice is a sovereign remedy. It should be applied
to the neck externally, and held in small bits in
the mouth. Small bits swallowed will sometimes
relieve the pains of gastralgia.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rubber bags are very convenient for applying
ice or iced water; but their place can be very well
supplied by dried bladders filled with pounded ice.
The ice cap is a double head cap stuffed with
pounded ice.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some physicians recommend the application of
ice to the spine in cases of congestive chill and
paralysis, and in inflammation of the stomach,
kidneys, uterus, and other internal organs. The
real worth of such applications in these cases has
yet to be determined by careful and repeated observations.
We would not recommend an unskillful
person to attempt to relieve a violent ague
chill by rubbing ice on the patient’s back, and we
have some fears that a very skillful operator
would hardly succeed to his entire satisfaction
and that of the patient.</p>

<p class='c007'>The snow bath, applied by rubbing the part
vigorously with snow, is a useful application for
restoring the circulation to frosted parts. In
cases of extreme chilling or absolute freezing,
there is perhaps no better remedy. Powdered ice
may be used when snow cannot be readily procured.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>
  <h3 class='c012'>MISCELLANEOUS BATHS, ETC.</h3>
</div>

<h3 class='c012'>VAPOR BATH.</h3>

<p class='c013'>This bath can be readily and successfully administered
with such conveniences as every family
possess. Place the patient in a cane-seat chair,
having first taken the precaution to spread over
the seat a dry towel. Surround the patient and
the chair first with a woolen blanket, and then
with two or three thick comfortables, drawing the
blankets close around his neck, and allowing them
to trail upon the floor so as to exclude the air as
perfectly as possible. Now place under the chair
a large pan or pail containing two or three quarts
of boiling water. Let the blankets fall quickly
so as to retain the rising vapor. After a minute
or two, raise the blankets a little at one side and
carefully place in the vessel a very hot brick or
stone, dropping the blankets again as soon as possible
avoid the admission of cold air. Before the
first brick or stone has cooled, add another, and
so continue until the patient perspires freely. The
amount of perspiration must be judged by the
face and forehead, as much of the moisture on the
skin beneath the blankets is condensed steam.
Should the bath become at any time too hot, a
little air may be admitted by raising the bottom
of the blankets a little, being careful to avoid
chilling the patient in so doing. The bath should
seldom be continued more than half an hour,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>and fifteen to twenty minutes will usually accomplish
all that is desired by the bath. If too long
continued, it induces faintness. A too high temperature
will be indicated by a strongly accelerated
pulse, throbbing of the temples, flushed face,
and headache. The head should be kept cool by
a compress wet in cool water and often changed.
The temperature of the bath should be from 100°
to 115°. Unpleasant effects are sometimes produced
at 120°.</p>

<p class='c007'>After this bath, apply the tepid spray, rubbing
wet-sheet, pail douche, or full bath. No time
should be allowed to elapse after the blankets are
removed before the concluding bath is applied, as
the patient will chill. He should not be allowed
to become chilly by exposure to cool air before the
application of the spray, douche, or other bath,
which should be followed by vigorous rubbing.</p>

<p class='c007'>For “breaking up a cold,” relieving rheumatism,
soreness of the muscles from overexertion,
and relaxing stiffened joints, this is a valuable
agent. It may also be used to advantage in
chronic diseases in which there is torpidity of
the skin; but great care must be exercised to
avoid excessive use, as too frequent repetitions of
the bath produce debility.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is a milder application than the hot-air
bath, unless employed at a high temperature,
120° or more, when it becomes more severe.</p>

<p class='c007'>In institutions where the bath is in daily requisition,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>a permanent arrangement for giving the
bath is usually employed. It sometimes consists
of a box in which the patient sits upon a stool,
his head being allowed to remain outside by a
suitable opening. A wet towel is placed around
the neck to prevent the steam from rising about
the head. Others prefer a box or small room large
enough to admit the whole person, the whole
body being subjected to the warm vapor. An
opening guarded by a curtain is made in one side
to allow the bather to inhale cool air if he should
wish to do so, and to give the attendant access to
the patient without chilling him by the admission
of a large quantity of cold air. As in the simpler
form of vapor bath, the head should be kept
constantly cool by a cool wet compress often re-applied.
Patients troubled with “rush of blood
to the head,” should be further protected by a
large cool compress placed around the neck and
the upper part of the chest.</p>

<p class='c007'>Steam may be generated for these larger baths
by boiling water in the box with a spirit-lamp
or a gas-burner, or it may be conducted into the
box by a rubber tube connected with a tight boiler.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>RUSSIAN BATH.</h3>

<p class='c013'>This is essentially the same in effect as the
vapor bath. It consists of a room filled with
vapor, and so arranged that by transferring the
patient from one point to another the heat may
be gradually increased. It has no advantages
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>not afforded by the simpler vapor bath. It is
now much used in the larger cities. Probably
as much harm as good results from the indiscriminate
and reckless manner in which it is employed.
Patients have been known to die in the
bath of apoplexy induced by the excessive heat.
It is followed by shampooing and cooling baths
of various sorts.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>HOT-AIR BATH.</h3>

<p class='c013'>In administering this bath, prepare the patient
precisely as directed for the vapor bath.
Instead of placing under the chair a vessel of
hot water, place a large alcohol lamp or a small
dish containing a few ounces of alcohol. When
all is ready, light the lamp or alcohol, and carefully
exclude the air. It is hardly necessary to
suggest the propriety of putting the lamp in
such a position as to insure safety from fire. If
alcohol is used in an open dish, it is important
to wipe the outside of the vessel quite free from
any trace of the fluid, as otherwise it might be
communicated to the floor or carpet. Also avoid
spilling any portion in putting it in place, for
the same reason. It is a very good precaution
to place the dish containing the burning alcohol
in a plate or shallow vessel containing a little
water.</p>

<p class='c007'>This bath should be conducted in the same
manner as the vapor bath. A temperature of
140° to 160° is not at all disagreeable to the patient.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>At 170° or 180° the same effects are produced
as in the vapor bath at 120°. The bath
should be followed by cooling baths as directed
for the vapor bath.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is a very valuable remedy for the same
class of diseases for which the vapor bath is
recommended. It is of very great service in
cases of dropsy, Bright’s disease with poisoning
from retained urea, and all cases in which
a vigorous elimination by the skin is desired.
It should not be continued longer than the vapor
bath, and much harm may result from its too
frequent employment. Like the vapor bath, this
may be conducted in a suitable box with an opening
for the head.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>TURKISH BATH.</h3>

<p class='c013'>This is entirely analogous to the hot-air bath,
though on a much more elaborate plan. The
patient is gradually conducted from a temperature
of 120° to that of 160° or even much more
than 200°. The bath is concluded by shampooing,
rubbing, cooling baths, and gradual cooling
in a room maintained at a temperature of 70°.</p>

<p class='c007'>The uses of this bath are the same as those of
the hot-air bath. It has no advantages over it
of very great importance, and is much more liable
to produce injury by prolonged and frequent
application. It generally occupies an hour, and
by those who resort to it as a luxury, as did the
ancient Romans, it is often prolonged to several
hours.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>The long-continued application of excessive
heat to the body is a very unnatural process.
It tends to produce permanent relaxation and debility
of the cutaneous tissues, and the manner
in which this bath is administered in Turkish
bath establishments is productive of great harm.
It is often presented to invalids as almost a panacea;
and is given alike to the strong and vigorous,
and the weak and debilitated.</p>

<p class='c007'>The bath is certainly good in its place, but it
is decidedly bad when abused. Many consider
the hot-air bath greatly preferable since it obviates
the necessity of inhaling superheated air,
the effects of which upon the lungs are said to
be injurious. The hot-air bath is doubtless safer.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>ELECTRIC BATH.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Electricity may be more efficiently applied in
connection with water than by itself. Water is
a better conductor of electricity than the dry
skin, and hence facilitates its communication to
the body. The ordinary method of applying
electricity is by attaching one pole of the battery
to a metallic plate, placed in contact with
some part of the body, while the circuit is completed
by the application to the patient of a
moist sponge connected with the other pole.
The operator often holds one pole in his hand
and applies the other hand, moistened, to the
part to be treated. He is in this way enabled
to judge very accurately of the strength of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>current applied. The metallic plate is frequently
placed at the feet of the patient, sometimes
in a foot bath. The sponge may be applied to
various parts of the body while the patient is in
a sitz bath. For a general application of electricity
the full bath is most convenient.</p>

<p class='c007'>This bath is applicable to a very large variety
of conditions. To describe them all would be to
give nearly all the uses of electricity as a remedial
agent, which does not come within the scope
of this work. The electric full bath has been
strongly recommended for the removal of mineral
poisons from the body. Just how efficacious
it is in this respect, we cannot confidently affirm.
Probably its value has been somewhat exaggerated.
Only the primary or galvanic current
could be of any service in this direction.</p>

<p class='c007'>Electricity is generally acknowledged to be a
powerful remedial agent; but its use requires
costly apparatus and much skill in application.
It is necessary that the operator should not only
understand the nature of diseases and the proper
methods of applying electricity in treating them,
but he must also thoroughly understand the general
laws of electricity. The electric bath is as
badly abused by quacks and charlatans as the
Turkish bath. It should not be employed by
unskillful persons; and for this and other reasons
given, it is not well adapted to home use.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>
  <h3 class='c012'>ELECTRO-VAPOR BATH.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>This is a combination of the electric and the
vapor bath, the electricity being applied to the
body by means of the sponge, and metallic plates
covered with moistened cloths. It is a valuable
appliance if carefully used; but, like all effective
modes of treatment, it is very liable to excessive
use, which becomes abuse. It has been very highly
lauded by certain specialists, and doubtless its
value has been unstintedly exaggerated. It is
perhaps not well proven that its effects are greatly
superior to the effects of the vapor bath and
electric bath administered separately; and the
latter mode would be more convenient, though
consuming a little more time.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>DRY RUBBING-SHEET.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Cover the patient with a soft, dry sheet in the
same manner as directed for applying the wet
sheet in the rubbing wet-sheet bath. Then rub
lightly but briskly upon the outside of the sheet
with the flat hand. Do not rub <i>with</i> the sheet,
but over it. Continue the rubbing ten or fifteen
minutes, going over the whole body several times,
and not neglecting the arms, the hands, and the
feet. This application may be administered daily
with profit to nearly all patients. It should always
follow any form of general bath in which
water is employed, as a means of drying the body.
It promotes activity of the skin, and equalizes
the circulation.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>
  <h3 class='c012'>DRY HAND-RUBBING.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>This application is much the same in effect as
the preceding, though a little more soothing, and
hence better adapted to nervous patients. It
consists in rubbing the body gently with the
palm of the dry hand. The force of the rubbing
should be nicely graduated to the condition of the
patient. When employed to excite considerable
activity of the skin, the rubbing may be accompanied
with kneading of the abdomen, and light
percussion of the surface.</p>

<p class='c007'>Gentle rubbing of the skin is a very soothing
process. It will frequently induce sleep when
other means are ineffectual. Rubbing the back
and limbs downward, and gentle rubbing of the
temples, are very soothing to children and nervous
invalids.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>AIR BATH.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The air has a very soothing effect upon the
body when allowed to come in contact with the
entire surface. It answers a very valuable purpose
when a water bath is impossible, or when
the patient is too feeble to endure the application
of water. A sleepless person will often fall
into a sound and refreshing slumber after walking
a few minutes in his room with the whole
body exposed to the air. The effects of night
labor upon literary people may be partially counteracted
by the air bath. Benjamin Franklin
was accustomed to pursue his writing to a late
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>hour after divesting himself of his clothing, and
he recommends the practice to others compelled
to labor late with the pen.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>SUN BATH.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The value of sunlight as a hygienic agent is so
universally recognized—theoretically if not practically—that
we need not devote space to its consideration
in this connection. Sunlight is essential
to the healthy performance of the vital functions,
and must be equally important as an aid
to remedial processes. This fact has been amply
demonstrated by hospital experience, which
shows a much larger percentage of recoveries in
rooms abundantly exposed to the sun than in
those secluded from its rays.</p>

<p class='c007'>That the sun has a powerful influence upon
the skin is shown by the great increase of pigment
in that structure when freely exposed to
the sunlight. This results from an increased
activity of the cutaneous tissues.</p>

<p class='c007'>Experience has shown that the sun bath can
be employed to advantage in most chronic diseases.
The patient simply lies in a position in
which the naked skin can be freely exposed to
the rays of the sun. The head should be shaded.
The bath should not be continued so long as to
produce unpleasant effects either upon the skin
or the general system. It may be accompanied
and followed with the dry hand-rubbing.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>
  <h3 class='c012'>SEA-BATHING.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Bathing in the sea is much practiced by fashionable
people who make annual visits to the
sea-coast for this purpose. It is no doubt useful,
though many who participate in it would doubtless
receive quite as much benefit if they took as
many baths at home during the whole year as
they take at the fashionable watering-places in a
single week. It is a fine thing to be well washed
once a year, however, if not more often.</p>

<p class='c007'>As generally conducted, sea-bathing is not more
beneficial than harmful. The dissipation accompanying
it more than counterbalances what good
might be gained. It is rather absurd to attribute
any specific virtues to sea-water, as many do.
Quite a large business is carried on in the evaporation
of sea-water and the sale of the dirty
residue, which is again dissolved in water and
used in bathing by those who live too far inland
to enjoy the benefits of bathing in the sea, or
who prefer to take their sea-bath in their own
private bath-room. Everything must have a
counterfeit, and so this seasalt is imitated by
base swindlers who prepare a mixture of chemicals
just as powerful, but not quite so complicated,
and less dirty, though certainly equally good.
All of this trouble and swindling might be saved
if people would only consider for a moment the
fact that all the benefit they obtain from bathing
is derived from the exercise, the temperature,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>and pure water, and not from any impurities
which the water may chance to contain.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sea-bathing is usually overdone. More benefit
will be gained by one or two daily baths than
by a half-dozen. Fifty baths in a single week
are not equivalent to a single bath each in fifty
weeks.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>MEDICATED BATHS.</h3>

<p class='c013'>We have no faith in medicated baths in general.
They are occasionally useful for the destruction
of vermin, animal parasites, and perhaps
in certain cases of skin disease. Generally, it is
far better to take the limpid element “Simon
pure,” unadulterated. Many medicated baths
have acquired great celebrity by the performance
of cures really wonderful, but wholly attributable
to water only, in spite of, rather than in conjunction
with, the foreign medicament added.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>OIL BATH.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Inunction was greatly practiced by the ancients
in connection with the Roman and Turkish baths.
It consists in rubbing the skin very thoroughly
with some unctuous substance. Olive oil may
be employed, but cosmoline or vaseline, two refined
products of coal oil, are in some respects
preferable. Olive oil cannot be obtained pure,
except at almost fabulous prices. That sold in
the drug stores as olive oil is really cotton-seed
oil and mixtures of lard with various other vegetable
oils.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>A warm bath should first be administered.
Then dry the patient, as usual, and apply the
unguent, taking care to rub it in thoroughly.
Simply greasing the surface is not the object
sought. The skin and flesh should be worked,
rubbed, and kneaded until the oil nearly disappears
from the surface.</p>

<p class='c007'>The object of this application is to supply the
place of defective natural secretion of oleaginous
material, to increase the activity of the skin,
and to diminish susceptibility to cold. How this
is accomplished, readily appears. The oil is a
simple substitute for the sebaceous secretion,
which is, in a certain class of diseases, notably
deficient. The thorough manipulation of the
skin which is necessary in applying the oil, and
which is facilitated by a lubricant, directly promotes
cutaneous activity. Whether the oil itself
has any direct effect in increasing the functional
activity of the skin cannot be positively affirmed,
although it is reasonably supposable that the
skin will act more nearly normal when a deficient
element is supplied than when it is wanting.
Oil is an excellent non-conductor; and invalids
who are especially susceptible to cold may
be rendered comfortable by the application of the
oil bath.</p>

<p class='c007'>The class of cases to which this remedy is applicable
will be sufficiently well indicated by the
purposes which the bath is supposed to subserve.
It should not be used indiscriminately. Once or
twice a week is sufficiently often to make the application,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>and each should be followed by a warm
bath with fine soap, two or three days after.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>NOVEL BATHS.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Numerous substances have been employed in
bathing, under the idea that they possessed peculiar
specific virtues; the following are some of
the chief:—</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Mud Bath.</i>—Immersion of the body in warm
mud has been a favorite practice at several places
in Italy, France, Germany, and other countries.
The effects are not very different from those of
any warm bath, and are said to be very pleasant,
by those who have taken them. If the mud
were not medicated, this kind of bath would not
be especially objectionable for those who could
enjoy it.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Earth Bath.</i>—Burying the body in the moist
earth has also been practiced. We have known
of one instance in which this remedy was successfully
used in the treatment of ague.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Bees’ eggs</i>, <i>milk</i>, <i>blood</i>, <i>wine</i>, <i>sand</i>, and <i>gelatine</i>
have also been employed by different nations, at
different periods, in bathing. None of these applications
are superior to pure water, which all
nature recognizes as the proper material for bathing
purposes.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>ENEMA.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Fecal accumulations in the lower bowel are
more quickly and easily removed by an enema of
warm water than by any purgative, laxative, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>cathartic ever discovered or invented; and the
use of this remedy is never accompanied by the
unpleasant and painful griping and tenesmus
which often accompany the use of cathartics.
The administration is a trifle more troublesome,
but the results are enough superior to more than
repay the inconvenience. The fountain syringe
is far preferable to any other for administering
injections. Water about blood-warm should be
used when the purpose is to relieve constipation,
and a considerable quantity—one to three pints,
or more—may be used. The water should be retained
for a few minutes, while the bowels are
kneaded and shaken. In hemorrhage and inflammation
of the lower bowel, cool or cold
clysters should be employed, and should be retained
as long as possible. The copious cool
enema is a valuable antiphlogistic remedy used
in conjunction with the cool bath in cases of violent
febrile excitement, as typhoid fever, when
the temperature rises above 103° F.</p>

<p class='c007'>The enema is a most perfect substitute for
purgatives in general. Cases are very rare in
which a cathartic drug will be found necessary if
the enema is properly used. But the enema may
become a source of mischief if abused. If habitually
relied upon to secure a movement of the
bowels for a long time, the bowels lose their activity,
and the most obstinate constipation sometimes
results, precisely as from the prolonged use
of purgatives.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>
  <h3 class='c012'>WATER EMETIC.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Warm water at about 92°—not hot water—is
a most excellent emetic if taken in sufficient
quantity. It is prompt in action, and is unaccompanied
by the painful nausea, retching, and
straining produced by most other emetics. From
half a pint to one or two quarts is required to
produce emesis. The patient should slowly
swallow a tumblerful, then rest two or three
minutes, and swallow another, so continuing to
drink for ten minutes or more. As soon as the
slightest disposition to vomit is felt—or even if
it is not felt, after a considerable quantity of water
has been taken—the patient should touch the
back part of his mouth with the end of his finger
or a feather, as far down as he can reach.
This will usually excite the desired action. If it
does not, all that need be done is to continue
drinking. A little salt added to the water will
make it more sickening, and will do no particular
harm, as it is thrown out again.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not claimed that the warm-water emetic
can replace all other emetics in <i>all cases</i>. When
instant vomiting is necessary, as in cases of poisoning,
some more prompt emetic may be used
with it. But for all ordinary purposes, it clearly
has no rival.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>DRY HOT APPLICATIONS.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The use of fomentations is often less convenient
or desirable than dry applications of heat,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>which may be made in a variety of ways. Bottles,
jugs, or rubber bags, filled with hot water,
hot bricks or stones, wrapped in papers or cloths,
hot cloths, bags filled with hot sand, salt, or corn
meal, are all convenient methods of applying dry
heat.</p>

<p class='c007'>A few suggestions with reference to the manner
of using hot applications may be useful. In
applying heat to the feet when the circulation in
those organs is defective, it is frequently insufficient
to apply the heat to the bottoms of the feet,
only. For this reason, jugs or bottles and stones
are often applied without effecting any satisfactory
results. A much more efficient method is the following:
Heat to a suitable temperature two or
three pounds of corn meal or salt. Place the
salt or meal in a bag sufficiently large to envelop
the feet. After distributing it evenly through
the bag, wrap the latter about the feet and cover
them with a woolen blanket. A rubber bag partially
filled with hot water is an excellent appliance
for use in cases of neuralgia, toothache, and
nearly all acute pains in the region of the head,
as it will conform so perfectly to the shape of
the part to which it is applied, and may be used
as a pillow.</p>

<p class='c007'>As a general rule, hot applications should not
be continued more than an hour or two, at longest,
without, at least, a transient application of a
lower temperature. Too prolonged an application
may result in injury to the part.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>
  <h3 class='c012'>WATER-DRINKING.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>As a remedial agent, water is of far greater
value than any other liquid taken into the stomach.
Its uses in preserving health have been
previously noticed. Under ordinary circumstances,
a person in health who discards irritating
condiments from his diet seldom requires
drink. Many persons take no drink whatever
during the winter months. But drinking is
healthful, and pure water of proper temperature
may be taken by any one in health or disease if
it is taken in the proper manner. Drinking at
meals is an unwholesome practice. Drinking
large quantities of iced water is unhealthful.
Cold water should not be taken freely when the
drinker is hot or exhausted. The thirst will be
quenched as readily by slowly sipping a small
quantity. In fevers, water should be freely allowed.
A glass of cool water taken half an hour
before breakfast is an excellent remedy for habitual
constipation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Water-drinking may be made a means of bathing
the internal structures, as external applications
bathe the outside. Water is rapidly absorbed
by the mucous membrane of the stomach,
and, passing through the circulation, it dissolves
many impurities, and is eliminated chiefly by the
kidneys and skin. It can be used with benefit
in connection with the vapor bath, hot-air bath,
and all baths in which sweating is induced. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>should not be used in such great excess as it was
employed by the early hydropathists, however,
whose patients drank from ten to thirty glasses
of water a day.</p>

<p class='c007'>Free drinking of water is useful in cases in
which the urine is scanty and irritating. It
gives relief by diluting the urinary excretions.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>HOW TO MAKE A FILTER.</h3>

<p class='c013'>For drinking, and for all ordinary purposes, it
is of the greatest importance that water should
be as pure as possible. When water which is
nearly soft, and wholly free from organic impurities,
cannot be obtained from wells or springs,
filtered rain water should be employed. A very
useful filter can be easily and cheaply constructed
in the following manner:—</p>

<p class='c007'>Make a hole low down in the side, or in the
bottom, of a large earthen jar or flower-pot.
Place in the bottom of the vessel a few clean
stones about the size of eggs. Fill the jar to
within two or three inches of the top with equal
parts of fine, clean gravel and pulverized charcoal.
Cover the jar with a clean, white cloth,
securing the edges by a string drawn about the
top. The center of the cloth cover should be allowed
to hang down into the vessel so as to form
a hollow into which the water may be poured,
the cloth serving as a strainer to remove the
coarser dirt. The cloth should be frequently
cleansed, and the gravel and charcoal should be
renewed at least once a year.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The following patterns are finely adapted to meeting the requirements
of healthful clothing. No woman should be without them. They can be
adapted to children as well as adults.</p>

<p class='c007'><b><i>No. 1.</i></b> A flannel undergarment to be worn next to the skin. It covers
the whole body from neck to wrists and ankles. Price, 50 cts.</p>

<p class='c007'><b><i>No. 2.</i></b> A garment combining chemise and drawers, arranged with buttons
so as to support the skirts and stockings from the shoulders. To be
worn next to the preceding garment in cold weather. Price, 50 cts.</p>

<p class='c007'><b><i>No. 3.</i></b> This garment combines chemise and drawers, and also supplies
the place of the corset so efficiently that those who have been accustomed
to wearing the latter article are happy to dispense with it after a single
trial of this dress. It is cut to fit the bust perfectly, thus affording all desirable
support. Price, with cloth model, 75 cts.</p>

<p class='c007'><b><i>No. 4. Gabrielle Dress.</i></b> This may be made either long or short to
suit the taste of the wearer. When worn with pants it should be from six
to nine inches from the floor. Those who do not wish to adopt the pants
may wear the dress two or three inches from the floor with dress drawers
and leggins. Price, 50 cts.</p>

<p class='c007'>We can also furnish patterns for skirts, pants for short dress, and dress
drawers with leggins, at 25 cts. each.</p>

<p class='c007'>Those who wish to secure a good fit should send the following measurements:—</p>

<p class='c007'>1. Bust measure, number of inches. 2. Under bust measure. 3. Waist
measure. 4. Length of waist under arm. 5. Hips, three inches below the
waist, 6. Width of back across shoulders. 7. Length of drawers from
waist down. 8. Length of back from neck to waist. 9. Length of sleeve inside.
10. Length of sleeve outside. 11. Length of shoulder. 12. Around
neck. 13. Around arm-size (high up).</p>

<p class='c007'>When desired, garments will be made at as reasonable rates as possible,
and sent by express. The patterns will be sent, post-paid, on receipt of the
prices marked. We employ an experienced dress-maker to cut patterns and
make garments, so that all may feel sure of obtaining a good fit if proper
measures are sent. We hope that our friends will not fail to avail themselves
of this opportunity for obtaining just what they need for their health,
comfort, and convenience.</p>

<p class='c007'>Its mechanism is so perfect that it accomplishes
all that could be expected or desired
of a filter to accomplish, and without the bestowal
of more than the slightest amount of
attention. It removes from water all those
products of decay and disease which are the

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c020'>These syringes have
become so popular
through the general recognition
of their excellencies,
that they have almost
entirely superseded all
other styles for most purposes.
The principal advantages
which they offer
over others are the following:
1. They are self-acting,
no pumping being required;
2. They are valveless,
and so simple in construction
that they cannot
get out of order; 3. They
do not inject air, and thus
do not endanger the patient;
4. By means of
the sprinkler attachment,
light shower baths can be
administered. 5. Various other attachments adapt them to use for every
part of the body. 6. The evenness of action with which they operate makes
them superior to every other syringe.</p>

<p class='c007'>No family should be without one of these syringes. They are used exclusively
at the Health Institute.</p>
